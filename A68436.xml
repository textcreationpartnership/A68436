         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that I had beſtowed both paynes, trauaile and charges (Right honourable) aboute the reducyng of this delightfull Hiſtorie of <hi>Gerileon</hi> into this our mother tongue, and had therein vſed the aduiſe and conference of ſundrie my freendes, I was aſwell by their counſaill embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as otherwiſe of myne owne nature, willyng, to preſente and conſecrate the firſt fruites therof (by waie of Dedication) vnto your good and honourable Lordſhip. The Hiſtorie it ſelf beyng firſte written in Frenche, was (in deede) for the greater parte thereof, after a kynde of ſorte, tranſlated by a certaine yonge man, more hardie and venturous in attempte, then luckie and Fortunate in atchieuaunce; whoſe good meaning, as it ſemeth to merite pardon, and perhappes ſome thankes: ſo vppon further ſcrutinie, examination, and conference of the copie with his Tranſlation, it was eaſie to finde where he had tripped, and where (vnawares) he had vtterly loſte his waie. Wherevpon I was driuen to ſuſtaine a double labour: One in perfectyng his imperfections: The other in finiſhyng and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that parte of the Booke, where he had abruptly broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, and abſurdlie ſkipped ouer.

In fine, herein is verie aptly ſhadowed out, a perfecte type of Dame Vertues Pilgrimage, whoſe naturall courſe, vſuall trade, and ordinarie happe, is through many ſharpe daungers, bruntes, and aduentures, to purchaſe the gole of honour and renoume in this life, and afterwarde a Croune of immortall Fame and glorie in the life to come: vnto the whiche I humblie beſeche Almightie GOD, after many yeres heere happely beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, to bryng your good Lordſhip.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10374:6"/>found. In ſo much that for this occaſion it hath béen often called the Lande aduenturous. Neither might any one of forraine Coaſtes or Countries name hym ſelfe a true and valiaunt knight, if in it hee had not made proofe of his worthines, there atchiuyng ſome ſtraunge aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. But eſpecially in the tyme of the moſte Puiſſaunt and vertuous king <hi>Brandiſmel,</hi> whiche hauyng by his proweſſe and valiauncy conquered many Realmes and Prouinces, as <hi>Norwaie, Swethlande, and Denmarke,</hi> inſtituted alſo the order of the twelue couragious knightes of greate <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> beyng ſuche, and endued with ſo greate force and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liauncie, that fewe their likes were as then to bee founde in the whole worlde. Amonge whom, for moſte valiaunt was the kinge <hi>Ferrande</hi> of <hi>Norwaie, Dom Grandilaor</hi> and <hi>Dom Murcibel</hi> king of Denmarke. The reſt alſo becauſe of their bounty, dexteritie and bouldneſſe in matters of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were greate praiſe worthy. For this occaſion was king <hi>Brandiſmel</hi> much feared and redoubted of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures and borderers, yet no leſſe beloued of them for his courteſie, liberalitie, lenitie, and humanitie, with other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues infinite, whiche were reſplendiſaunt in hym. And in ſuche forte, that there was not hee whiche (doyng hym the moſt toyleſome and agreable ſeruice hee coulde) did not yet eſtéeme himſelf moſt happy to be inſinuated into his good grace and fauour, ſo to gaine his gratious amitie. But the fatall Siſters (moſt impious, and enuious of the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and felicitie of humaine kinde, and of thoſe eſpecially whiche retaine a ſingular contentment and pleaſure to bee in the fellowſhip and acquaintaunce of a Prince ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and debonaire) bereft them the ſhinyng gleames of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and myrour of Chiualry out of this worlde, ſhrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſonder the laſt thréede of this ſo vertuous a king, the yere of grace after the death of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>418.</hi> the <hi>66.</hi> yere of his age, and <hi>32.</hi> of his raigne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon I can not rightly expreſſe the dolour &amp; ſorrow that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10374:6"/>the couragious knightes his Subiectes receiued with his moſt priuate and beſt frendes. In ſo muche that (as recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs the Hiſtorie) there were ſuche of them as remained twoo or three Monethes, without power to refraine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from weeping and lamenting moſt bitterlie, when as it came to them in minde of the Bountie and Vertue of that noble Prince. And chieflye the worthy olde <hi>Candior</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Prince ſurelie amongeſt the Sage and hardy, muche commendable. Neuertheleſſe as there is noe griefe ſo greate, whiche in courſe of tyme (a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer of all thinges) is not put foorthe of remembraunce: So for iuſte cauſe this good Lorde of <hi>Normandy,</hi> together with the reſte whiche were moſte dolefull for the loſſe of a King ſo debonaire and vertuous, at laſte made ende of their plaintes and lamentations. And for iuſte cauſe ſaye I, in that he lefte them for ſucceſſour, a Sonne of his, begotten by his deere and loyall Spouſe and Wife <hi>Florixe</hi> (whiche not many yeres before had departed this life) whiche ſaide ſonne after the death of his Father was Heire, not onely of his terreine Dominions and Poſſeſſions, but alſo of his moſt rare and ſinguler vertues. For beſides that he was a good knight, prudent and hardy paſt meaſure, beeyng of a large ſtature, his members well made, formed and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in equality, the one with the others, of ſixe or ſeauen and twentie yeres of age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or there aboutes: he was alſo had in reputation for the moſt ſage, modeſt &amp; courteous Prince of his tyme. In ſo much that (to make briefe) no man could require or wiſh any thing proper or conuenient for ſo great a perſonage as his, whereof his valiauncie and inuincible proweſſe was not beautified and adorned. This ſame was called <hi>Floridamant,</hi> the which did neuer finde man (of what force or puiſſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſoeuer he were) who daring to Iuſt with hym, hadde not geuen plainly to feele and vnderſtande, that he was peereleſſe and not matcheable. For this cauſe there was no knight in all Brittaigne the Greate, whiche at his
<pb facs="tcp:10374:7"/>newe arriuall to the Crowne, did not deliberate and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to conuerte and tourne the lamentations and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinges of his Fathers death into ioyes and gladneſſe, for hauing after the loſſe of a good Lorde and Maſter, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and receaued a better kyng. To whom there lacked ſo litle, that he ſhould degenerate from the bountie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his predeceſſour, that by his vertue (whiche rather more then leſſe did hym illuſtrate) he did in ſuche ſort ſtriue and endeuour in equalitie of valiauncie, and good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to imitate and counteruale hym, that his Knightes, Princes and Barons, with other of his Vaſſailes and Seruauntes, thought in no wiſe to haue chaunged their Maiſter: who vnwillyng to omit anye iote of his greate magnificence, a while after his Coronemente, made and gaue ſo many faire and Godly Giftes and Preſentes, not onely to the couragious knightes his Subiectes, but alſo to ſuch ſtraungers as were come to viſite him, and to make offer to hym of their ſeruice (beeyng nothyng ignoraunt that liberalitie rendreth men ſubiect and bounde towardes thoſe whiche vſe it:) that there was not he, whiche pricked and prouoked with a deſire to doe him agreable ſeruice, (ſo muche his lenity and liberality had charmed and enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their affections,) would not willinglie haue put his life in hazarde, for the maintenaunce &amp; conſeruation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And for that, that a little afore the deceaſe of the good king <hi>Brandiſmel</hi> his Father, he had eſpouſed the daughter of king <hi>Barrachen</hi> of Scotlande, named <hi>Bellizenne,</hi> a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe as ſage and vertuous, as faire and gracious (for fewe there were) who then for beauty &amp; good grace, durſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with her:) There were come to viſite hym, the twoo valiaunt Princes, <hi>Hubert</hi> of Scotlande, Brother to the Queene <hi>Bellizenne,</hi> and <hi>Dorian,</hi> Sonne to the kinge of Spaine, whiche had aforetymes beene Compagnions of Armes, and atchiued many Exploites and haughtie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes with hym. He determined to addreſſe and make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

The whiche, beſides the Architecture and magnificent buildin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with diuerſities of woorkes, whereof it was framed and wrought, the moſte pleaſaunt and riche of all others, as then to be ſéen, was in like maner ſo delectable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, becauſe of the ſaid wood wherwith it was enuironed, more then a myles compaſſe aboute, that it was vnpoſſible to ioyne ought thereunto, to geue enlargement to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, in all that which one could deſire or wiſhe to a place of like pleaſaunce, there entered into the Hal a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of meane beauty, whoſe countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to ſée to, ſéemed ſo bedewed with teares &amp; dolefulnes, that one would haue thought that of long tyme ſhe had done nothyng but weapt and lamented, in that as yet appeared along her face the trickling Teares, diſtilling by groſſe and greate droppes. This ſame Damſell apperceiuyng the king, whom ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med well to knowe, came to proſtrate and fall doune on her knees before hym, and ſighyng bitterly (eache one hauyng purſued her to vnderſtande that whiche ſhe would ſaye) ſhe ſpake on this ſorte. <q>Moſt puiſſaunt king, in whom al boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and worthines of Chiualry and vertue aboundes, more then in any other vnder Heaven, the ſame of your proweſſe, humanitie, courteſie and value (which ſo often hath flowed from the one till the other ſide of the worlde) hath cauſed mee to come from farre euen to theſe Coaſtes, to requeſte and beſeech youre Royall highneſſe (the whiche I truſte is not diſpuruaied of mercy ne pittie) that taking compaſſion of the moſt vnfortunate and miſerable Damſell that liueth, it may pleaſe you, in reſpecte of the order of knighthoode, whiche you haue taken, not to denie me your ſuccour and ayde, againſt the moſt preſumptuous &amp; wicked wight that

But I hauyng ſo greate confidence and affiaunce in your bounty and proweſſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you onely may matche hym and geue hym the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe, whiche hath bene cauſe, that reiectyng all feare and ſhame through the neceſſitie which oppreſſed mée, thus ouerboldly and vnreuerently I haue dared to beſeech your Royall highneſſe, to bee ſo fauourable to mee in this my ſo vrgent affaire, aſſuryng my ſelf that not forgettyng in any pointe the duetie of a wiſe and valiaunt knight (ſuche a one as you are accompted) which is to ſuccour Ladies &amp; Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles afflicted as I am, you will not gaineſaie ne denie mee of the requeſt whiche I pretende to make to you: for that no man euer heard ſay, that for cowardiſe or ſlackneſſe (vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whiche lodge not in you) you euer diſdained, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly denied any other, who (as I now do) requeſted you to geue them, aide and ſuccour.</q> After that ſhe had made an ende of her tale, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king (which had ſeen her in ſpeaking, weepe ſo bitterlye, and three or fower tymes to breake of with ſuche continuall and hartie ſighes and ſobs, that there was no harte ſo harde, cruell and vnpitifull, whiche ſhe would not haue moued to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion) tooke ſuch pity of her, that hauyng cauſed her to ſtande vp, where afore ſhe knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he made her this aunſwere. <q>Damſell tell mee hardly in what affaires my ſuccour may ſerue and be fauourable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: promiſyng you that nothyng forgetting my duetie, I will hazard my life to ſuſtaine your right, or at the leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I will knowe what therin you haue.</q> Then the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell greatly appeaſed &amp; ſatiſfied, with ſo good and gracious an aunſwere, thankyng hym for the ſame with a lowe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, coloured her viſage with ſomewhat more ioye then ſhe brought, therein painted a while afore, and ceaſſyng her
<pb facs="tcp:10374:9"/>teares ſaide vnto hym: Than I deſire you Sir, to geue mée audience, while I make you a recitall of my ill lucke and miſfortune, and attentiuely to vnderſtande the forme of myne aduenture more vnhappie then anye other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euer mention was made ſince the memorie of man. Wherin it is meete you knowe, that I am by birthe of the Lande of Thrace, and Daughter of a Noble and vertuous Kynge, named <hi>Minoberis,</hi> who in hys tyme hath beene as ſtrongt and valiaunte in Armes, as anye other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but ſo ſmallye fauoured of Fortune, that nowe ſhe ſuffereth hym to conſume the reſte of his age, ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as is poſſible to imagine: for that he liueth in a Priſon made cruell and tirannous, with a torment tenne hundreth tymes more ſharpe then the horrour of death it ſelfe. And thus it chaunced that one daie, as hee was in the queſte and purſuite of ſtraunge adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures to make proofe of his force and valure, &amp; alſo to get praiſe and honour (the only Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Illuſtrious and gentle hartes, as all wanderyng knightes accuſtomably doe) paſſing by chaunce through a certaine Forreſt, he encountred a wilde Boare, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſtriken and wounded through the bodie with a Darte, came and fell doune not farre from hym ſtarke dead, which he apperceiuyng, tooke and charged vppon his horſe to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away: but as hee beganne to departe, there came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes hym another knight of ſo ſmall ſtature, that hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not the height of two or three cubites, but therwith ſo ſtrong and puiſſaunt, that no knight nor Giaunte what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, might endure his force, and for this cauſe ſo fearce and preſumptuous, that if he ſawe any thing to hym not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable, were it wrong or right, he would haue it. This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe ſeeing the praie whiche my Lorde and Father caried, ſaid to him very ſtoutly, that he either ſhould deliuer &amp; geue to hym the wild Boare out right, or otherwiſe he would let hym vnderſtande that it was not for ſuche a one as hym to gainſaie any thyng to hym agreable, My father, which had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10374:9"/>his Hearte ſo fixed and ſettled, and who was of ſo greate courage, that he could in no wiſe ſuffer ſo preſumptuous a bragge: to hym anſwered, that he ſhoulde not haue it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conqueſt made by the pointe of the Swerde. Whereon the litle knight whiche had to name <hi>Nabot,</hi> was ſo chaffed and enraged, that putting without more wordes his hande vpon his Swerde, he ſtroake my miſerable father ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon the head, that at the firſte blowe hee brought hym doune all aſtoniſhed from his Horſe to the grounde: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after he had laied the wilde Boare, he tooke my Father betwixt his armes and caried hym into the moſte ſtraunge and Butcherous Priſon, that euer was hearde ſpoken of. For beſides that, he hath clogged his feete with greate and weightie Giues of Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I knowyng this (my Lorde) haue been often before hym, to entreate hym to haue my Father raunſomed, at what he woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But hee therein hath alwaies gainſaide mee, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyng mee with like crueltie, if in fixe Monethes I coulde not prepare and preſent a knight whiche ſhould bee able in iuſtyng, to bryng hym from of his Horſe. Whiche thyng I endeuouryng to doe, haue brought hym already, full many: parte whereof he hath ſlaine, and parte whereof he hath put in a priſon farre more miſerable then that of my poore Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

And ſeeyng than, when he leaſt thought thereof, the occaſion too bee miniſtred ſo to fit his purpoſe, to make proofe of the force and valiauncie of hys perſon, by encountring with that mightie <hi>Nabot,</hi> he would not lette it ſlippe ſo.

Therefore it is to be vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in greate Britaigne there was an Itande adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſaied Realme, which men called the gréene Ile. Whereof a knight named <hi>Mynofol</hi> was Lorde and ruler, who from his infancie had ſo beſtowed his tyme in the arte of <hi>Necromancie</hi> and ſupernaturall Magicque, that by the ſame he atchiued many marueilous Matters, and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many others who dealed there with to be leſſe expert then he in his arte. In maner that by his enchauntmentes and diabolicall charmes hee had builded in his Ile a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, the moſt ſumptuous and magnificent that with mans eyes was euer ſeen.

And with reuerberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame, the Aire &amp; Trées of the Ile appeared as red as Fire, for a Miles compaſſe aboute. And it was to bee marueiled greatly, how the knight <hi>Mynofol</hi> could build any ſo ſumptuous and ſtately an Edifice, as the red Caſtell (ſo did the vulgar ſorte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly name it) ſeyng

This ſame <hi>Minofol</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng, beeyng once acertained by his Mother, for
<pb facs="tcp:10374:12"/>what occaſion his father had cauſed hym fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tender ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſo curiouſly to be endoctrined, &amp; taught in this diueliſhe Arte (in the whiche, ſince hee was arriued to good age) hee was ſo ſkilfull and experte, that fewe like to hym were as then to be founde. As one that was of his Fathers nature and diſpoſition, that is to wit, a Traitour, wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengeatiue, hee imagined in his fantaſie too put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the purpoſed pretence of his predeceſſour. And for to bring to paſſe the ſame, he ſtill had taried till after the death of the good kyng <hi>Brandiſmel</hi> (ſeyng no meanes duryng his life to finiſhe his conſpiracie, and vengeable falſhodde) that hauyng builte the redde Caſtle, whereof I haue afore ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he addreſſed the Damoſell towarde the Kyng <hi>Florida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> to require hym of that you haue harde aboue recited, knowyng hym prompt and hardie to giue ſuccour, and aide to Dames and Ladies wronged and offended. And for that he knewe, he had often tymes, ſearched for <hi>Nabot</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with hym, to the ende to entrappe and withdrawe hym more eaſely to hym, he appointed hym the meſſage, whiche you haue fully ſeen in the Chapiter precedent. For that the Damzell, doughter to the knight <hi>Minoberis,</hi> whiche <hi>Nabot</hi> had in priſon, had ſone perceiued hym to put in practiſe, to deliuer her Father, whiche thyng he denied her: And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng his profite of her requeſt, inſtructed the Damoſell his couſin of the Plot before ſpecified: who plaied ſo well her part that ſhe brought the Kyng alone after her, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her, ſo as is afore ſaied, as faſte as his horſe could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppe, without euer atteinyng to her. For ſhe had a palfrey poſſeſſed with a Deuill, whiche the Magician there had by his enchauntmentes put: for that he went ſo ſwifte, that of all that daie nought did he but trot, without ceaſſyng, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng: and the Damoſell rapped hym exceſſiuely, feinyng to haue greate haſte, vntill ſuche tyme as the nocturnall darckneſſe, had chaſed farre into the Weſte, the ſhinyng chariot of <hi>Phaeton:</hi> then ſhe ariued in a Foreſte thicke.

Wherein beeyng entered farre afore, the Kyng who ſtill purſuyng her as nere as poſſiblie he could, at laſte loſt ſight of her: and not knowyng where ſhe was become, he ſtaied ſomewhat his horſe, to harken if he could any whit vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the tramplyng of her Palfreis féete, therby to follow her trace: but that was in vaine. For he heard nothyng els, but an infinite noyſe and yellyng of ſauage beaſtes, as Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, wilde Bores, Lyons, and ſuche like, whiche made ſo greate a yelling, that there ſcarce one could haue heard the bounſing clapps of ſoundyng Thunder. Whereof I leaue you, to thinke if the kynge had occaſion or no, to bee aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and greatly abaſhed. In that I déeme none ſo ſure and ſtable, whiche would not haue been afraied at that tyme, to approache and enter a place ſo daungerous. Notwitſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng he was of ſo magnanimious and haughtie a courage, that, that ſeemed to hymſelf leſſe then nothing: ſauing that he could no more finde out his guide and conductreſſe. But endeuouring hymſelfe to ſearche for her, it was vnpoſſible to make his horſe either to go forward or backward, what blowes or ſpurres ſoeuer he could vſe. And whether it was for the wearines and feeblenes of his limmes, or for feare that hee had to ſee himſelfe in a place ſo hydeous, after hee had beene long tyme pricked and ſpurred: hee on a ſodaine fell groueling to the earth, whereof the good king <hi>Florida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> beyng aduiſed, and wightly forſaking the Saddle, ſet foote on ground, and leanyng his Elbowe againſt a Tree, with his head againſte his hande, remained a long ſpace in that forte, aſtoniſhed muche and merueilouſly: ſo ill ſtoode his caſe, vntill ſuch ſeaſon as hee heard farre before him in the Forreſt a voyce Feminine, which complained moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. Then plucking vp his harte, he thought to haue béen,
<pb facs="tcp:10374:13"/>in no dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger at all, and blamyng himſelf for hauyng remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſadde and penſiue ſo long, was ſomewhat eaſed in that he had heard a humaine voyce, in a place ſo roughe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, wherein he deemed nothyng els to haue béen, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and cruell beaſtes. And deliberated (ſuppoſyng that to be his Damſell, which ſome one had offended) to go to that place were he deemed her to bee. And to ſuccour her the better: hee cooke his naked Sworde in his hande, and his Shilde vpon his Arme: wherewith marching through the Forreſt, he encountred a Knight throughly armed, and horſed as well as was poſſible, whiche in appearaunce ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be fraught with hardineſſe. To whom he ſaied with greate anger Syr Knight, wherfore is it that you haue ſo outragiouſly and cowardlike miſuſed a Damoſell whiche came in my companie, whom not long ſince I haue heard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine here abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But by my headde I ſweare, I will geue you to knowe, that it is right ill doen of you, to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo greate wickedneſſe and villanie. During whiche wordes the knight which doubted little, that after his hoat and many wordes, he would haue vſed ſuche ſharpe deedes as he did, for feare leſt the King ſhould kill his Horſe: ſette foote on earth ſaiyng. By GOD, vaſſall, you haue falſelie lyed, for I knowe not of what Damoſell you ſpake, rather I beleeue it is your ſelfe, whiche haue miſuſed one whom I haue hearde complaine. But for feare leaſt I ſhould accuſe you of that villanie, whereof you ſpeake, you are come to preuent me: purſuing with your ſworde to kill my horſe, by that meanes to make me fal, and to flea me more eaſely: but yet you are further out of your accompt, then you are ware of. Notwithſtandyng, ſeeyng you are ſo well prepared to Combate, I will geue you thereof your fill. Then beganne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10374:13"/>he to preaſſe full bouldly vpon the king, who receiuing him with marueilous hardines, after the receite of ſome of his aduerſaries blowes vpon his Shielde, which through the firſt weight &amp; violence thereof, was pearced in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, entreated hym at laſte (after a long Combating, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauyng aduauntage the one of the other) in ſuche and ſo rude a maner, that the knight whiche thought hymſelfe not matcheable, wiſhed in minde that hee had not met with ſuche a mate. Alwaies (notwitſtanding) defending himſelfe the beſte that hee could, made in a maner that the medling was ſo harde and ſharpe as euer was ſeen of twoo knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes onely. Whereof the king greatly maruailyng, hauing neuer found knight that made hym ſo long reſiſtaunce, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into ſo deepe choler, that yrked with the longe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the Combate, he tooke his Swerde in both han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and with the ſame diſcharged with al his force, a ſtroke ſo violent vppon the creaſt of his aduerſaries Helmet, that neither the Shielde which he caſt before it, nether the good workemanſhippe of his Harneſſe could warde or warrante it: without beeing battered and cruſhed together, and the Swerde paſſing further, well néere cut his head in twaine.

               <p>But duryng this thought of hers, beholde there ariued a troupe of Knightes and Damoſelles, whiche brought thither a faire horſe litter, all wrought within with Blewe veluet, who went with greate haſte toward the place where the Queene was: and findyng her in the ſame takyng, that the Damoſell <hi>Antiziliane</hi> had lefte her, liftyng her vp ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, laied her in a good bedde whiche was in the Litter, with the litle baby by her, whom her Damoſell wrapped &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with riche clothynges, brought redie for that purpoſe: which doen, thei quickly conuaied her to the Caſtell of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randol.</hi> Where thei no ſoner ariued, but the Prince <hi>Ferrand</hi> of Norwaie, whiche was in the Citie of London, without further delaye, with a greate troupe of illuſtrious and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt knightes, came to viſite her, muche ioyous and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſo good an aduenture, truſtyng that now the Queene would for euer after, leaue of her griefes and complaintes: who gaue hym in charge to cauſe the Infant to be baptized whom ſhe would haue to bee-named <hi>GERILEON,</hi> with the greateſt ioy and ſumptuous preparation, that ſhe could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare: not lettyng paſſe, either Iuſtes, Turneis, or any other paſtymes, whiche could bee inuented.

And thei proclaimed that whoſoeuer ſhould take in hande this matche, ſhould giue to the victours one of the faireſt, and moſte riche tokens, that euer thei had receiued of their Miſtreſſes: and if perchaunce there were founde any, who hauyng fixed and ſette his affection, in a place too haultie and difficile, were ſo vnfortunate in his Loues, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer har receiued any, he ſhould bee bounde, and holden to faſte wholie three daies, without either meate or drinke, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng breade and water, and he ſhould fulfill his promiſſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it was alſo ſaid, that all thoſe whiche ſhould proteſt that thei were frée, &amp; exempte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flames of loue, ſhould goe knele doune before the Damoſels of the Quene <hi>Bellizenne,</hi> kiſſyng their feete, and the ſtones in their Ryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche thei had on their fingers with all humilitie. Which thing being knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery one of the knightes, who hearde theſe Iuſtes proclaimed in ſo ſtraunge and vnvſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all condition, ſaied to the Heraulde, who had to name <hi>Gelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste</hi> the Ioily: What is that (ſaieth hee) that maie bee doen in lieu of kiſſyng the Rynges of their fingers, if by chaunce ſome of the Dames want them.

At this cloked knauiſhe aunſwere, was greate laughter moued, not onely to the byſtanders, but alſo to the knight to whom he ſpake,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10374:19"/>who (although he ſawe hym ſelf mocked) was little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng thereat diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>But (to come to the matter againe) the Iuſtynges bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng openly Proclaimed, as is afore ſaied, one might haue ſeen knightes of all partes, to prepare theim ſelues to the ſame, on the one ſide of the Liſtes: and on the other ſide the twoo braue warriers <hi>Dom Ferrande</hi> of Norwaie, and <hi>Dom Grandilaor</hi> his Coſine, fully determined to make that daie, ſuche a proofe of their knightly proweſſe, that worthe ly thei ſhould bee iudged valiaunt at thoſe Iuſtes aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

And the like, ſaied thei of that valiaunt prince of Norwaie, who purſued hym full nere: for in proweſſe and Chiualrie, he ſurpaſſed eche other knight of greate Britaine. But as thei were entred within the Barriers to combate, beholde, the heauen beganne in leſſe then an hower, to waxe ſo darcke, and too become ſo troubled with thicke and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſmoke, whiche remained in the ayre, more then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an howre, that the knightes could not ſee from the one eude of the Liſtes to the other: in ſuche ſorte that there
<pb facs="tcp:10374:20"/>was none ſo hardie and valiaunt, whiche was not greatly aſtoniſhed and abaſhed at this ſodaine &amp; ſtraunge mutation of tyme: for neuer any of them that were in that companie, had ſeen the like chaunee. But yet thei had more cauſe of maruaile, when after hauyng a while beholden through the the ayre, whiche waxed yet more darcke, eſpecially aboute the Caſtell, a multitude of hideous flames of fire, as redde as bloud, thei heard ſuche a terrible and vnaccuſtomed thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And beeyng ceaſſed, the ayre became in leſſe then an howre; as cleare and bright as afore. But thoſe that were aſſembled in a troupe, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues farre diſperſed eche fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, raunged &amp; ſcattered here &amp; there more then a Bow ſhoote: becauſe their horſes beeyng afraied of the greate brute, whiche thei had heard, did ſeparate theim ſelues the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other on euery parte. But ſeyng an olde Towre, whiche was at the ende of the old walles of the Caſtel parke, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered more then twoo Foote thicke with Juie, ſome greene, ſome withered, to bee no more there, gatheryng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſelues together, thei ran haſtely towardes that parte, to ſee where it was become. And beeyng there ariued, thei found it all couered with aſhes, &amp; plucked in peeces ſmaller then duſte: as alſo thei perceiued before the gate of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, twoo greate pillars of Marble white and graie, cutte and pight fower ſquare, the moſte faire that might be ſeen, ſuſteinyng theim ſelues aboue by an arche, moſte magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centlie emboſſed and grauen with woorkes Damaſkinne, vnder the whiche was the purtrature of a Maiden, richely-apparelled like a <hi>Nymphe,</hi> and ſo faire that Beautie her ſelf might not bee named, but by her name: hauyng a ſmilyng countenaunce, wherein ſparcled and ſhined ſo linely, the

For there was founde but one, whiche was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous, and in Loue, called <hi>Dom Gillant</hi> of <hi>Bartage,</hi> who was of the number of the twelue couragious knightes of Greate Britain, moſte hardie and cunnyng in his weapon, but in Iuſtes hee was caſte doune to the yearth by <hi>Dom Grandilaor,</hi> after the breakyng of fower Staues, without remouyng himſelfe: but at the fifte he was diſhorſed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was ſo chaffed and angred, that hee woulde not performe the decrees of the game. Whiche thyng <hi>Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> ſeeyng, ſaied to hym: Knight, will ye not goe kiſſe the Rynges and feete of the Ladies, as it was accorded before wée came to the Juſtes, the one againſte the other?

Truely he will keepe it long, ſaied <hi>Grandilaor</hi> ſmilynglie: for if he frame not hym ſelf to accompliſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he ſhould haue no power to eſcape from hym. But whiles he diſcourſed thus with the mery &amp; ioyly <hi>Geliaſte,</hi> he tooke of hym a Speare, whiche he had in his hande, for that

                  <hi>Dom Haroalt,</hi> whiche alſo was one of the xij. couragious knightes of the Realme, approached to runne againſt him: who ſeeyng hym with Speare in reſte, pricked his Horſe with the ſpurres, and came runnyng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym (who did the like) ſo rightly, that makyng their Speres flie in ſhiuers, whiche had touched both their Shieldes, thei perfourmed brauely their Courſe without any maner mouing from the Sadles. Wherefore takyng newe Speares more bigge and ſtrong then the firſte, they came to the ſhocke againe ſo fiercely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Shieldes, that their Trunchions fliyng on high in the ayre, their Steedes mette with ſuche a furie, breaſt againſt breaſt, that, that of couragious <hi>Heroalt</hi> was conſtrained (as not beeyng ſo ſtrong as the other) to fall there doune, and his Maiſter by hym. Aſſuring you that if <hi>Dom Grandilaor</hi> had not ſtrongly reined the heade of his Horſe, he had meaſured hymſelfe alſo on the Earth. But he hare hym ſelf there ſo valiauntly, that his Couſen <hi>Ferrand</hi> and he, remained all the daie victorious, and ſo well cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them ſelues from beeyng caſte to the grounde, that none had the puiſſaunce to winne of them, the twoo white Steedes.

For the Prince <hi>Dorian</hi> beyng retyred from thence, and hauyng made certificate of all theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the good kyng of Norwaie, and the reſte of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of Greate Britaine, thei remedied the matter ſo well, and gaue ſo good order to their affaires, that the ſaied <hi>Minofol</hi> beeyng ſlaine by the handes of the ſaied Prince <hi>Dorian,</hi> who in the ſkirmiſhe encountred hym, and thruſte his Speare through his bodie, that his folkes were forced, with greate flaughter and bloudſhed, ſhame and perpetuall diſhonour, to retourne from whence thei came.</p>

The boye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deſirous to haue her, ſeyng her ſo faire &amp; brauely feathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue the reſte, purſued her: and ſeyng that ſhe ſat more nere hym, and ſéemed better then afore, he ſet again the head of his arrowe againſt her: the birde ſeyng her ſelf manaſſed flewe yet a little farther. The boye, in hope to haue her, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her ſtill from tree to tree, &amp; were it with chaſe or ſight, he neuer left her: till that beyng gredie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> game, the birde hauyng brought hym in fine by little and little, farre into the thickeſt of the Foreſt, did vaniſhe awaie, in ſo muche he knewe not where ſhe was become, for in no place that he could caſte his eye, he could not ſee her. Whereof he was ſo ſorrowfull and vexed, that he brake bothe his bowe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, rentyng and pluckyng in peeces the quiuer, whiche hanged by his ſide, through the greate ire and ſpite he had: as well for that, not hauyng obtained the Phaiſante, as for that he could neither finde again the waie, by the whiche he came thether, nor any other path to returne out the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And ſeeyng this, after he had remained long penſiue, ſittyng on the greene graſſe, bedewed with aboundaunce of teares, he fell on ſleape, leanyng his heade againſt a tree. And ſo long he remained in that place, that neither the Queene, nor any of her houſe, knowyng where he was become, for that the Sunne drewe al readie dounewardes, and that all the daie, ſince mornyng he had not been ſeen of any bodie, cauſed quickly to mounte on horſebacke, the couragious Knights <hi>Heroald,</hi> and <hi>Accial</hi> of Surrie, to go one waie, to ſee if thei could finde hym, and <hi>Dom Candior,</hi> with his ſonne <hi>Sylban</hi> of Flanders, an other waie: who hauyng done greate dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſearchyng hym, wer forced to returne, the Sunne hauyng ſuffered the dareke and ſhadie brightneſſe of the

Whereof it needeth not bee ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, if the Queene were paſſioned and greeued, or noe. For of all that night it was not poſſible, that ſhee coulde geue place to any one iotte of reſte: but wéepyng and lamentyng bitterlie, ſhe made ſuche pitifull complaintes and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, accompaignied with ſuche a number of ſkaldyng Teares, whiche iſſued aboundantlie out of her faire eyes, that there was no hearte ſo hearde, fell or cruell, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would not haue taken pittie and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>In ſo muche that for feare whiche I haue to moue you to beweene her greate dolour (ſeeyng that I ſtriue not but to ſtirre you to pleaſure) I am content to ſet my ſelfe to ſhowe them here: for the ſeuere <hi>Medaea</hi> apperceiuing her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of her frende <hi>Iaſon,</hi> or <hi>Thiſbe</hi> in the Boſome of her beloued <hi>Pyramus,</hi> finding him dead, did not ſende ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſorrowfull ſighes, ſobbes, and pitifull complaintes, as that night boyled from the breaſte, eyes, add mouth of this vertuous Princeſſe, for the loſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Infant. And I boldlie beleue, (that although of magnanimous and haughtie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, yet had it not been for the Princes <hi>Candior</hi> and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilaor,</hi> who pained themſelues ſtill aboute her with double diligence (as they ſaie) to mitigate and diminiſhe the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of her anguiſh) with her proper handes, like <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> for loſſe of her chaſtitie, ſhe had made an ende both of her life, and lotheſome languiſhing dolours. But theſe wiſe Princes did ſo muche, that promiſing her to finde him out the nexte daie, thei ſomewhat appeaſed theſe firſt motions of her anguiſhe: in ſo muche that after ſhe was with care couched vpon her bead, appareled as ſhe was, ſhe fell a ſlepe vntill the next mornyng, that <hi>Sol</hi> was alredy rouſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lodgyng of his Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man <hi>Aurora:</hi> at which tyme ſhe awaked, ſo wearie, waſted and weakened with the force of the forepaſſed plaintes, that ſcarſe ſhe could lifte vp her heauie head from the painefull Pillow. Then demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
<pb facs="tcp:10374:25"/>if her ſonne were yet found: and beyng aunſwered by the Damozell <hi>Antiziliane</hi> (who kepte her ſelf continually nere to her Grace, for feare of her miſcariyng through the multitude of theſe miſchaunces) that he was not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned. Ah (ſaied ſhe) then let me goe ſe, if I maie be more fortunate in findyng of hym then the reſte, in hope to haue hym ſhortlie in the place where my fancie foretelles mee he is: for in ſleepe it was ſhewed me, where and how he was to be founde, laide vnder a Tree. And taking ſecretlie a knife, vnperceiued of any, ſhe conuaied it vnder her Kirtle, and framed her foote ſteppes towarde the Forreſte, to a Place the moſt thicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> darke and deſert therof.

                  <q>Alas, (ſaied ſhe) what may this meane, that then, when I thinke to ſe the brightnes of my felicitie, I enter and am plounged more further in the obſcure and darkſome dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of my diſtreſſe and miſhap: and hoping to reioice at one happie and fortunate nauigation, by the gleamyng of a iot of fraudulent and deceiptfull light, whiche was to me apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, I feele my ſelf fruſtrated, of mine eſperaunce, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ingulped in the profoundeſte place of ioyleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations, and ragyng Riuers, moued and ſtirred vp by the horrible blaſtes of the moſte vehement windes, vppon the Seas of the anguiſhes, ſorrowes, and Pittes of myne importable paines.

The Youth without anye aſtoniſhment, ſeeing hym ſo meeke and humble, without doyng hym any harme, tooke hym by the eare, and led hym towarde the Caſtle, to the place where the Faierie was, to whom hee ſaide: Madame, ſee I praie you what a kinde of Dogge I haue founde in the Forreſt.

But I beleue, that the Dames and Ladies, belongyng to the Queene <hi>Bellizenne,</hi> and other greate Princes at that feaſte preſente, were ſo honeſt, that for motionyng there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it was but loſte time.

But while theſe thynges were a doyng, I muſt tell you that the king was no leſſe idle in kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng his Queene <hi>Bellizenne:</hi> For as he daunced with her, thei ſo mutually beheld, and caſt ſuch glauncing lookes the one to the other, with ſuch fine &amp; ſwéete countenaunce, that the dimmeſt of ſight, might well haue deemed, what deſire they had of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ioye, which ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g had been reiourned, In ſuch forte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Kyng beyng in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt courſe of the daunce, more luſty, braue, &amp; wel diſpoſed, then he had béen ſince his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, or long afore, retired ſecretly, without ſemblaunce of any thyng, into his chamber: whither full ſone after, the Quéene hauyng followed hym, I leaue you to ponder, if in ſuche libertie, as thei had to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the one with the others appetites, beyng enflamed as thei were, the ſwete daliance and amourous embracementes, were in any wiſe ſpared. For why, as telleth vs the Hiſtorie, thei ſo forgotte theim ſelues, in their delightes and plaies, that thei remained more then an whole hower, afore they retourned too ende the daunce in the Hall, déeming that of the chamber, better. Whiche was chief cauſe, that ſhortly after the Queene felt her beallie ſo bigge, that her garmentes were too little for her. For ſhe conceiued a daughter, whom ſhe awhile after, bare and brought foorth, ſo perfecte of feature, that many braue Knightes were enflamed with her loue, and ſhe was named <hi>Polydame,</hi> of whom wee will make more ample diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>And on this wiſe eche one for his parte, applied hymſelf to pleaſure, and to contente his mynde the beſte he could: as when wee ſee a faire and Sunne ſhine daie, to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, with a ſodaine ſhadowe of a darke and duſkie cloude which couering the Sunne, ſheweth ſuch ſadde cheere, that

                  <q>Softe, my freende (ſaied the Faierie) deemed you me ſo doultiſhe or vndiſcréete, that I would ſende you towarde ſo greate and noble a Lorde, as the Emperour of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople is, to receiue the order of knighthoode, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture both of Horſe and Harneſſe, according to your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng?
<pb facs="tcp:10374:37"/>I promiſe you to be as well thereof prouided, as any Knight in the world ſhall be, &amp; better: neither ſhall there be any, that either in goodneſſe of Horſe or Harneſſe ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe you, to the ende to make you redoubted and feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt, &amp; to demonſtrate the degrée whence and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are. Wherefore I will tell you nothing vntill ſuche tyme that through your vertues and valiauncie (whereof your deedes ſhall yelde cleare teſtimonie) you haue merited to bee called and eſteemed the Sonne of hym who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten you: if not, as well you thinke you bee not my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sonne, but iſſued from a ſtocke royall, whereof I praie you ſpeake no more: for at Gods appointment you ſhal wel knowe it, the regarde whereof in all your déedes and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, I praie you to haue aboue all thinges before your eyes, and the Honour of Ladies and Damozelles in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation together, alſo with the loyaltie and fidelitie of her, whiche in ſhorte ſpace ſhall rauiſhe you, of the beſte thing you haue in you.</q> The youth without any replie made to her, either further of his Race, or any other matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though verie curious, noted and well marked, all that whiche the Fairie had ſaied to hym: chiefly her laſte woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, purpoſyng with hym ſelf, that none ſhould rauiſhe hym of ought that he had: but he was more out of his accompte then he thought. And hauyng been ſilente a certaine ſpace, he ſaied to her: <q>Madame, then I praie you, ſhewe me if it ſo pleaſe you, what furniture you will beſtowe on me, to the ende that to morrowe Mornyng, I maie finde it all readie, when it behoueth me to departe, and alſo what Squire you will that I haue.</q> Then the Fairie tooke the Lion, whiche the youth had founde in the Foreſte, whiche as then laie ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng vnder the Table like a Dogge, and recityng certain woordes of Enchauntemente, and annointyng hym with a kinde of licour whiche ſhe had, ſhee cauſed hym to receiue the forme of a youthfull manne of twentie yeres of age, or there about. And you muſt vnderſtand, that this was <hi>Gelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10374:37"/>the Ioylie, Squire to the Queene <hi>Bellizenne,</hi> who in ſearchyng the youth <hi>Gerileon</hi> at firſte, when he loſte hymſelf in the Woodde of Cipres was by the Faierie, chaunged from his firſte forme, into the likeneſſe of an hideous Lion, and had without waxyng olde, in anye wiſe, remained ſo till that time: followyng vſually the youth into euery place like as the Dogges alſo, to the chaſe: Wherein he killed multitudes of wilde beaſtes. He alſo had the ſame apparell whiche the other had, when he was firſt Metamorphoſed, or rather (if it be not lawful to empaire the Greke language) to ſaie better, when as he chaunged his firſte ſhape. At this thyng bothe the Youthe, and alſo the poore Squire muche maruailed. For the Squire remembred of nothing paſte, no more then as if he had been but euen then borne: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng that hee was the ſame, and had like Senſe as hee had before.</p>
               <p>But the Fairie addreſſyng her ſpeache to the Youth, ſaid to hym: My freende, ſee here is now the Squire whiche I meant to giue to you for ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when you brought him to me at the firſt: &amp; you <hi>Geliaſte</hi> (ſaid ſhe to the Squire) ſée here your Lorde and Maiſter, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will that you ſerue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie in all that, wherein he ſhall haue néede, and through all places where he ſhall paſſe. Now (moreouer ſhe ſaied) you want nothyng more but Horſe &amp; Harneſſe. And takyng hym by the hande, ſhe ledde hym ouer the ſteppes, whiche ſtoode againſt a baſe Court, wherein when thei were come doune, the Youth ſawe the moſte gallant, braue, greate, and beſte made Horſe that euer man ſawe, ſince the death of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephall</hi> kyng <hi>Alexanders</hi> Horſe the Greate: of whoſe kinde and bréede the Faierie had ſo wrought, that ſhe had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this of a ſtraunger <hi>Theſſalion</hi> called <hi>Philonicus:</hi> who of twoo faire Horſes whiche he had, ſolde the one to kyng <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> for thirtene Talentes, that is <hi>Bucephall,</hi> and this whereof wee ſpeake, to the Faierie <hi>Oziris</hi> for eightene, whiche was called <hi>Lycocephall,</hi> for that that he had on his
<pb facs="tcp:10374:38"/>forehedde, the forme of a Wolfes hedde, &amp; was farre fairer &amp; greater then the other. For the Fairie had alwaies after her buiyng of him, kepte and garded him wel in her Fairie: ſo that he was in no pointe, either waxen older, or empai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And this was dooen, purpoſely for to make a preſente thereof vnto <hi>Gerileon,</hi> as well to hym appartained. Who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng hym ſo faire, was therof ioyous, and fain he would that it had as then béen daie, that he might haue departed, and to haue mounted on his backe. For he toke hym by the bridle, out of the handes of the <hi>Nymphe Aegle:</hi> whiche hauyng not long before, brought hym out of the Faierie, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Oziris</hi> her Miſtreſſe, helde hym as yet: ſo he mountyng lightly vpon him, without aide of Stirrope (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were bigge and mightie, more then any other as then to bée found) cauſed hym fower or fiue tymes to fetche the carrire nimblie, and to gambolde luſtelie, from the one ſide of the Courte to the other, and made hym to gallop ſo impeteouſlie, that beſides that, he wente more ſwifter then any Swallowe, he made the yearth tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vnder his feete, in ſuche ſort, as neuer was afore ſo ſéen: wherein the Youth tooke ſuche greate pleaſure, to make hym tourne, and paſſe to the one ſide, and to the other, without any ſpurres at all, that if the Faierie had not ſaied, that ſhe would goe ſhewe hym the Harneſſe, whiche ſhe would giue hym, I thinke that he would not haue alighted in one whole hower. But after ſhe had tolde hym thereof, the greate gladneſſe that he had to ſee it, made hym deſcende quickelie, and to followe her into her Cabinette. From whence ſhe brought ſtore of harneſſe, the moſte ſumptuous, induſtriouſly engrauen, and moſte richely gilded, that was poſſible to ſée: without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paintyng in the ſhielde, then a greate Croſſe of golde, whiche ſtretched from the one ſide to the other, in a fielde of Azure, whiche was Enchaunted in ſuche ſorte, that no Yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor Steele (how harde ſo euer) could in any wiſe harme it: but rather contrarily, the harder &amp; violenter that the ſtroke
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10374:38"/>which fell vpon it was, the more it hurt hym which gaue it, then hym whiche receiued it. For in ſteede of enteryng or percing into it, the Sworde, Speare, Clubbe, or other ſuch warlike inſtrumente, rebounded ſo high into the ayre, that often tymes it fell out of his handes, whiche was the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, and vſed it. This Harneſſe became and fitted hym ſo well, as though it had been of purpoſe appointed and made for him. And after this, ſhe fetched out of her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binette, a Sworde large, faire, and of marueilous good edge: the Scaberde whereof, was of the ſkinne of a greate Serpente, whiche was ſlaine by <hi>Hercules,</hi> at what tyme he was verie young: The whiche was ſo finely trimmed, that although it was not garniſhed with diuerſe Diamon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and other precious ſtones: yet beyng ſette againſte the Sunne, it would haue rendered a farre finer lighte, then golde it ſelf. It is moſte true, that the Sworde was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fitte to the Scabarde: for the puiſſaunte <hi>Nabot</hi> kept as then, that, whiche was made for it, whiche was the beſte that was in the worlde. For there was no Harneſſe, of what goodneſſe ſo euer (no although hardened by enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente) that could reſiſte it, without beeyng cutte, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in peeces. And it was called <hi>Duranſarde,</hi> whiche the ſaied <hi>Nabot</hi> had conquered, and gotten from the terrible and hideous Giaunte <hi>Scarafarab,</hi> who was of the linage of <hi>Encellade,</hi> one of theim whiche in tymes paſte, would haue conquered Heauen: and were with Lightnyng deſtroyed by <hi>Iupiter</hi> (as it is ſaied in the firſte Chapiter of the thirde parte of Chronicles of <hi>Brandiſmell,</hi> compiled by <hi>Galarx</hi>) whereof the Faierie <hi>Oziris</hi> was greatly greeued. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could ſhe poſſiblie recouer it, although ſhe had alreadie gotten the Scaberde, wherein ſhe gaue this, that I now ſpeake of (whiche was matchable in higneſſe, and almoſte in makyng and goodneſſe to <hi>Duranſarde</hi>) to the Youth of the Faierie (for ſo muſte wee hence foor the name hym). Whiche cauſed her greately to doubte, leaſte any euill

She had alſo greate feare, leaſte any ſiniſter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes ſhould happen vnto him, by the meanes of any Yron Launce Enchaunted: againſt whiche, his Armoure, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what ſoeuer, had no power to reſiſte: whiche was in poſſeſſion of an other moſte braue, and valiaunte knighte, Sonne to kyng <hi>Belligent</hi> of Fraunce, called <hi>Diodamas,</hi> whiche was giuen to his ſaied father the kyng of Fraunce by the noble kyng <hi>Brandiſmell,</hi> to whom the Faierie <hi>Oziris</hi> had made preſente thereof, at what tyme hefought with the mightie Giaunte <hi>Perciuall.</hi> Wherevpon ſhe aduertiſed the Youthe, that he ſhould endeuour to get bothe the Sworde and Launce, as ſone as he ſhould be made knight. Who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had thanked the Faiery, for all this faire &amp; riche furniture, whiche he gaue in cuſtodie to his Squire, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired ſtraight waies thence, by reaſon that the darkeſome night, beganne as then to chaſe the bright ſome Daie, from out of the Celeſtiall Mannour, to the ende to take his reſt, that he might the ſoner bee ſtirryng in the next Mornyng.</p>

For the Youthe of the Fairies, (hauyng withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen hym ſelfe into the Chambers, after his Harneſſe whiche <hi>Ozyris</hi> had giuen hym) was brought in thither, he laied hym full ſoone in his bed: where he beganne to ſleepe well for a while, thinkyng to rife before daie the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, accordyng to his earneſt deſire.

Whereof <hi>Geliaste</hi> whiche in his Cloathes was couched vpon a little fielde bed in his Maiſters Chamber, beyng firſt awaked, runne halfe a ſlepe as hee was, to awake the Youthe: who muche blamed hym, that he had not doen it afore tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but he ſware to hym by his honeſtie, that he had called hym twoo howers ſince: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſound ſlepe, he had ſuffered him to reſte ſtill: and better to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme his ſaiyng, he ſaid that he had well broken his faſt, and drunken a good Cuppe of white Wine whiche was geuen hym. Wherefore the Youthe blamyng his too muche ſluggiſhneſſe, conuerted &amp; tourned the anger on him ſelf. And taking in greate haſte his apparell, by the helpe of his Squire, was quickly cloathed and alſo harniſed. Than deſcendyng doune into the Halle, founde his breakefaſte all readie, where he had ſcarce either eaten or drunke, but he mounted vpon his braue Horſe <hi>Lycocephal,</hi> and his Squire vppon an other: &amp; after leaue &amp; congee taken of the Noble Fairie <hi>Ozyris,</hi> &amp; of the faire <hi>Naiades,</hi> who at his departure wept and mourned bitterly, he departed and went ſtraight towardes the Porte, where he founde a Barke full fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; appointed ready to paſſe, wherein whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the Pilot launched forth and hoiſte vp ſailes, the winde being to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fauorable.

Aſſuryng my ſelfe (although as yet you ſeeme too tender of age, to be called to ſuche vocation) that if the bountie of your harte bee correſpondent to the beauty and appéeraunce of valure whiche I deeme and coniecture to be in you, you are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and capable to diſcharge ſuch a charge as well as any other that now liueth whatſoeuer: and for that cauſe there reſteth no more as nowe, but that you goe to prepare your ſelfe, as the cuſtome is, for to receiue the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, when as you ſhal pleaſe and be thervnto ready.</q> Then the Youth, thanking hym humbly as well he could: retyred ſecretly thence, to goe make his praiers in the Chappell of the Pallace as the cuſtome was, where re remained till it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10374:42"/>was the next daie mornyng, at what tyme hee came to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hymſelfe to the Emperour, who dubbyng hym with the Necke ſtroake put on his right Spurre, and the Lady <hi>Porphyria</hi> who had ſcene hym come, deſcendyng doune, girt his Swerde about hym, by the commaundement of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whiche to doe, ſhe was well pleaſed: and the Youthe who (whiles ſhee did her deuoyre in this behalfe, muche marueiling at her miraculous beautie) was not ill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the chiefeſt, faireſt &amp; beautifulleſt Princeſſe vnder Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did vnto him ſo great a ſeruice. This done: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who the more he beheld him and ſaw him ſo garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in all pointes, the more he was willyng to wit, who he was, he required and aſked of hym his birthe, and the eſtate of his race and progenie. To whiche the youth made a moſt ciuile aunſwere, <q>that he was of the Realme of greate Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but of none of his Parentes, had he any knowledge: and that for this cauſe it might pleaſe him to excuſe hym, if he were conſtrained herein to kéepe ſilence: true it is (ſaid he) that I know well, neither will I conceale it from you (moſt noble Lorde) that I was nouriſhed by a Fairie, who ſent mee towardes you ſo furniſhed as ye ſee, &amp; ſhe is called <hi>Ozyris.</hi>
                  </q> The Emperour who aforetime had heard talke of the Fairy, deemed &amp; doubted that ſhe had kept hym for ſome occaſion (as moſt certaine it was) beyng proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the progeny of the noble kynges of Great Britaine, as ſhe had aforetime done by the vertuous king <hi>Moridant,</hi> father to <hi>Brandiſmel,</hi> which was the firſt extoller of that magnificent Realme, and much marueiled thereat. Neuertheleſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more talke with hym, he commaunded ſome of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauntes, that they ſhould conduct hym into the Empreſſes Chamber, to paſſe foorthe the tyme with her Damozelles, and to diſcourſe with theim of many an honeſte &amp; amorous deuiſe, as well (it ſeemed) he could. But the Youth willyng to excuſe him ſelfe herein, praied hym humbly that it would pleaſe hym to geue him leaue to retourne into Greate Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb facs="tcp:10374:43"/>there to ſeeke aduentures: ſo to aſſaie if the order of knighthoode, whiche he had obtained, were well or euill employed vpon hym. And alſo that he had greate deſire to Juſte and Combate with king <hi>Floridamant,</hi> which as then was had in priſe for the beſte and valiaunteſt knight in the world. The Emperour not well pleaſed in that he would ſo ſoone departe from his Courte, ſaied to hym. <q>Why (faire ſir) will you ſo ſoone abandon vs and our Court, not in any wiſe feaſted or cheared there as yet, accordyng to your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng? I promiſe you, that if you will remaine with vs but the ſpace of fiftene daies, that beſides the good and honeſte entertainement whiche I hope thereby to beſtowe on you. you ſhall here alſo finde knightes both braue and ſtrong to make proofe of youre valour and proweſſe, ſeeyng your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente deſire is ſo to doe. For I muſt one of theſe daies make a moſte ſumptuous Feaſte, duryng the whiche, neither Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis nor Tourneis ſhalbe lackyng: wherein you maie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment your valiance in this behalf: therby to prepare your ſelf the better againſt the worthy knightes of greate Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whiche are the flowers of chiualrie in the worlde, and chiefly as you ſaie againſt kyng <hi>Floridamant,</hi> who hath not his match vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And I ſuppoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> otherwiſe it would ſoner turne to your diſhonour then aduauncement, and that it ſhould rather be imputed to your raſhneſſe then courage.</q> The Youth hearyng the Emperour ſpeake with ſo greate modeſtie and charineſſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued a certain ſingular loue of his prudencie, and ſuche a one as forced hym with a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feare not to offende his heſtes, neither to doe any thyng diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable vnto his mynde: &amp; knewe that he had erred in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng to departe, hauyng receiued farre aboue his deſertes, ſo muche honour of ſo greate a lorde as he was, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng hym any deede of duetie of ſeruice. Wherefore to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his fault, he ſaid vnto him. Seing it pleaſeth your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to doe me ſo muche honour, as to reteine mee in your court, it ſhalbe then my dutie to go about to do you the beſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10374:43"/>ſeruice I canne: <q>Aſſuryng you that no worldlie felicitie, could happen as now more greater, nor more agreable to my mind, then to haue the meane hereby to ſatiſfie your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and deſires. And ouer that, I ſhall thinke my ſelf moſte happie, it I maie gratifie your contentment, in dooyng you ought whiche male bée to you pleaſaunt and agreable: that I maie ridde my ſelf out the bandes of foule Ingratitude: wherein I were faſte linked, if I did not putte in practiſe to atchiue your commaundementees, and accompliſhe your deſires: Seyng you haue alreadie ſo bounde and made me yours, that it is paſte my power, euer to ſhewe you ſo muche ſeruice, but that ſtill I ſhall bee farre in your debte and daunger. Wherfore I am not of power (ſince ſo it pleaſeth you) to paſſe the limites of your will. The Emperour well contente and ſatiffied, with the gracious aunſwere of the Youthe of the Faieries, commaunded againe a Damozell, whiche was there preſente, that ſhe ſhould conducte hym to ſée the Empreſſe Chamber: Whereto ſhe promptly obeyed.</q> And takyng hym by the hande, ſhe ledde hym neere where ſhe was, accompanied with ſo many faire Ladies and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozelles, that at his entraunce within the Chamber, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſe ſo many Angelles in Paradiſe, as there were La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies waityng aboute the Empreſſe: who talkyng with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Princes there with her, ſhe made theim ſtande ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a ſide, the better to ſee the Youthe of the Faieries: who enteryng into the Chamber, ſaluted her humblie: to whom when ſhe had vſed like curteſie, ſeeyng hym ſo faire and courteous, ſhe could not ſticke (being muche aſtoniſhed to ſee a young manne ſo comely) to ſaie to them whiche were about her: I beleue that if this Youth haue the bountie and proweſſe of the minde, equal and matchable to the makyng, and proportion of his body, he will be the beſt and worthieſt knight vnder the Skies. And whiles ſhe ſaied theſe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the Youthe beyng approched more nere, ſhe beganne to aſke hym of his birthe, and why he was come into a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But hee whiche well knewe howe to ſhifte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two walles, was ſcarce contented to be conuerſant with them, for that there he could not ſee one ſparke of the beautie of her, which girded his Sworde about hym, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was ſomewhat attached: for that, ſhe whiche had caſte her eyes on hym ſo attentiuely, beganne alreadie to haue her ſenſes troubled, through the loue of hym: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſhe was retired ſecretly into her chamber much pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue: at whoſe iſſuyng foorthe, that chaunced vnto hym, whiche you ſhall heare.</p>

Alas it ſo behoueth not any to gouerne them ſelf: it is not fit to vſe ſuche faſhions and deedes: for if you proceede anie further, I aſſure you, it can not chaunce but to your greate diſhonour, beyng in fine diſcouered.

Deeme you, that I haue ſo lightlye apprehended and emprinted, the loue of the yonge Gentleman in my harte, that I can diſburden my ſelfe thereof at pleaſure, as you ſaie? Seing that the ſame ſhould proceede from me, rather of a greate imperfection of iudgemente, dependyng vppon an opinion without effecte, then of the loyaltie and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which I am alreadie reſolued to beare him, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of my life: whiche ſurely ſhall ſhortly take ende, if I knowe not quickely, that his amitie is reciprocall, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente to myne. No, no, if euer ye did me pleaſure, or if euer you had a good mind to gratifie me, it behoueth you my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; frendes, that at this preſent you doe mee ſo much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, as to ſearche where he is, and to learne by ſome honeſt and ſubtile maner, if he may finde in his harte to loue mee, or if he haue his mind fixed els where.

Leige Princeſſe (ſaid <hi>Marcella</hi>) to tell or certifie the Youth that you are amourous of him, or to giue him other notyce therof, then by the eyes (which are the true and accuſtomed Meſſengers of the moſt priuie intentions of the harte) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are ſo ſtiffely bente neuer to loue any other: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth me, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done, w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tout inferring great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to your perſonage.

<pb facs="tcp:10374:50"/>thervpon he would hould hymſelfe ſo proude and pre ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, if in this caſe he caught ſinatche of the leaſt thyng in the worlde, that in lieu of louing you, he would rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine you. Neuertheleſſe, I wil tell you what I haue ſeene, and more then that, haue marked: that when ſo euer he hath chaunced to ſee you, he hath no leſſe chaunged countenance then you, which maketh meedeeme, that whereſouer he be, he is not altogether exempte, from the feelyng of affection like to yours: which thyng we may throughly know to the truthe, duryng theſe fiftene daies which he hath to remaine here. In ſuche prefixed ſpace, I beleue, that if there bee anie goodneſſe in hym, wee ſhall knowe it. For hee will be at the Iuſtes which the Emperour wil cauſe to be proclaimed to morrowe, as I vnderſtande: wherat all the beſt knightes of Conſtantinople, wil bee as Aſſiſtauntes: and <hi>Don Gillant de Burtage</hi> of Create Britaine, who is merueilous vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, will bee there alſo: againſt whom, we ſhall ſee howe he can beare hym ſelfe, and what he will doe moreouer, if he haue any affection towardes you. For if it bee ſo, I aſſure my ſelfe, that if hee maie vanquiſhe any, he will ſende hym to bee your Priſoner, or will vſe ſome ſuche gentleneſſe or courteſie in your behalfe: for verelie it ſeemeth mee, that if hee bee of ſo hie linage, or if he bee ſo valiaunte as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce he ſeemeth, certes he is worthy to bee beeloued of ſome greate and beautifull Princeſſe. Wherefore, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, I praie you, ceaſſe your Teares, that you giue not out any ſuſpicion of your diſtreſſe: be temperate till to morow, and then I promiſe to giue you counſell, vpon further deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, more wholſome and agreeable, then preſently I can. For now we muſt goe towardes the Empreſſe, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her of the dolour wherein ſhee yet reſteth, ſuppoſing that by this time, you are neere hande dead.

And I deeme he might haue remained ſo longer, had it not been for his Squire, who ſought hym on all ſides, by the commaundement of the Emperour, to come to Dine with hym: who wente ſo farre from chamber to chamber, and in ſuche order, that in fine he founde hym dreamyng, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Cardeine, in ſuche wiſe, that he called hym twiſe or thriſe, beyng verie nere vnto hym, before he heard or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiued hym: who approchyng more neere to hym, called out on this ſorte. <q>Hola Maiſter, what meane you, are you become deaffe or blinde? For now it is a whole hower ſince I haue been here with you, to tell you how you muſte come to the Emperour to Diner, in all whiche while, ye haue not made ſemblante, either to heare or ſee me. And how? (In
<pb facs="tcp:10374:52"/>Gods name) more then an hower, Saied the Youthe of the Faieries? Yea forſoothe, ſaied he. But not of theſe greate howers, whiche you thinke not, but of theſe ſhorte howers, whiche paſſe in ſo ſmall ſeaſon, as you maie employe in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng you thriſe at the leaſte. Aha (ſaied the Youth) I beleue ye well: For I haue my mynde ſo buſied otherwiſe, that it maie well be, that not thinkyng on thee, I haue ne ſeen nor heard thee. What Sir? And whereon maie you haue your thought ſo fixed? Vnleſſe it ſhould bee, that you were ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the loue of the Emperours doughter, who is eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the moſte perfecte in beautie, that is knowen preſentlie to bee in the worlde. Verelie if you haue ſeen her, I thinke you haue taſted enough, whereon ſo to occupy your though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. O <hi>Geliaste</hi> (ſaied he) for Gods loue ſpeake no more to me of that: For I haue neuer ſeen her, but to my greate da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Wherefore I praie thee, that incontinentlie after dinner, my Horſe &amp; Harneſſe be ready: for I meane, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any prynie to my determination) to abſent my ſelf hence, ſo to baniſh &amp; defeate this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I willingly wil Sir, (ſaid the Squire) but by mine honeſty, ſince you haue ſo farre gone, I feare you halfe loſte, if you vſe none other remedy but abſence. And what thing more expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may I vſe, replied the Youth, I would wiſhe you (ſaide he) to finde meanes to ſpeake to her, and to lett her vnderſtande youre Paſſions, poſſiblie ſhe will take ſome pitifull compaſſion vppon you, or at leaſte wiſe, ye ſhall receiue by diſcouery of your euill, ſome recure and helpe. For ſo would I deale if I were in your caſe. Hence Sotte that thou arte, thinkeſt thou mee ſo ill trained by, that I ſhould ſeeme to giue the leaſte ſuſpition poſſible of my Sorrowes, either to her or to any other perſon, againſte all reaſon? Naye, take thou alſo good heede from giuyng out anye aduerſe ſpeaches I warne thee: conſideryng the greate reproaches whiche I maie incurre by my foly, in that ſuch a ſimple Knight as I, not wittyng my ſelfe from whence I am, ne euer haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10374:52"/>feate, worthy of the fauour of the worſt Damozell in the worlde, dare aſpire to ſeeke the acquaintaunce of one ſo greate a Princeſſe: who, if I ſhoulde doe as thou ſaieſt, ſhee worchely ſcorning mee, would not (I feare) deigne to take mee for the worſte of her ſeruauntes, hauing many my het<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in worſe place of ſeruice than that. Wherefore neuer moue mee more of ſo manifeſt a folly: And what my Lorde (ſaide again <hi>Geliaste</hi>) how is it that your heart is ſo baſe, &amp; puſillanunous, that ye beare not your ſelf in worth, alwaies aboue a woman? Not aboue ſuche a one as ſhe (ſaid he). Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie (aunſwered the other,) if euer one had ſeen mée breake a couple of Launces againſt a dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghill, (which is eaſie you know) &amp; that I were horſed at aduauntage, as you are: alſo if I had your beautie &amp; perſonage, I know not ſo gallaunt a Girle in all this Towne, but ſhee would thinke her ſelfe happie, to haue mee for her frende. Therefore (Maiſter) my beſt aduiſe and counſell is, that to morrow you ſhewe your ſelfe valiaunt, and couragious in the Iuſtes, whiche ſhal be: for (ſurelie) by that meanes ye ſhall winne her heart. Thou ſpeakeſt now better then y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> diddeſt erewhile (ſaid the Youth. And I will not onelie proue my ſelfe to morrow at the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: but alſo (if I liue) will (to make my ſelfe more renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) goe ſearch ſtraunge aduentures in Greate Britaine, and Combate with the beſt Knightes that there be, yea not exceptyng King <hi>Floridamant,</hi> who hath ſo greate renoume of valiauncie, before I will aſſure my ſelfe to obtaine the good grace and fauour of my newe Maiſtreſſe, whom I am determined to ſerue and honour in mine hearte, as long as life ſhalbe reſident in my bodie, and to her onely will I vow my loue. Wherfore reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that, which I haue ſaid to thée, that after dinner my Harneſſe be readie: for I will not bee knowen to morrowe when I ſhal come to the Iuſtes.

               <p>So, ſecretlie deuiſing together, they arriued in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb facs="tcp:10374:53"/>Halle where the Tables were couered againſte dinner. And the Emperour being ſet doune, cauſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth to be placed next vnto hym, ſo to doe hym the more honour, and all his Knightes &amp; Barons after hym in order: who at dinner time were all armed with their Sweardes by their ſides, and Helmets on their heades, &amp; did eate hauing their Beuers put vp: the Gates of the Pallace being all ſhut, and many Souldiers about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, to be their guardes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Youthe of the Fairies muche merueiling, could not but enquire, whether it were the cuſtome of the Countrie, ſo to dine Armed: thereby to honour the Emperour the more, who onelie was vnharnized, or if there were anie déeper occaſion, which draue them ſo to doe. <q>Know (Youth, ſaide the Emperour) that accordyng to your opinion, this is not doen without cauſe. For againſte ſuche a daie as to morow (which is the daie of my natiuitie) I haue annually accuſtomed to make a moſte ſumptuous Feaſt, whereunto I call all my moſte priuate frendes, and grande Princes of mine Empire, as you ſée here preſent, &amp; appoint Iuſtes and Tournmentes, and all other ſortes of paſtime. But whiles we are in mirthe and feaſting, we alwaies feele our ſelues troubled in ſome ſort, by the inuaſions of a monſtruous and vnreaſanable higge Giante called <hi>Ferclaste,</hi> who kéepes an Houlde, not paſte fower of fiue Miles hence, in a certeine Rocky caue, commonly called Rocke Alpine: who with his twoo Breethren, who are neither better nor leſſer then hee, and another rauenous kenell of Dogges whiche hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, neuer faileth as to morowe, to come and doe ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to ſome of the Citie: as to rauiſhe ſome maide, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Knight. In ſo muche, that the laſt yere, hee came hither euen into this Hall, and with his greate Club, euen in my preſence, hee cutte of the Dukes head of <hi>Chalcyde,</hi> who was a Knight righte wiſe and valiaunt. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more this night laſt paſt, word was brought vnto mee that he had rauiſhed a gentlemans daughter of my Court, called
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10374:53"/>
                     <hi>Florenges,</hi> who nowe is not here for the greate dolour hee hath of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of his daughter. And doeth me ſo many other outrages (againſt which I can finde no remedie nor order, for that hee ſtill keepeth hym ſelfe encloaſed in his Rockie Cabin) that I can not well declare theym. Manie worthy Knightes there haue beene as well of this Empire, as els where, that haue fought with him hande to hand, but neuer was ſeen any to retourne: for either he quicklie killeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elles quietly keepeth theim in Priſon: and amongeſt the reſt he hath one, if happlie he be not dead, who was the beſte of all my retinewe, and for whom (as well therefore, as that he is my Neuewe) I am muche ſorowfull, and hee is called <hi>Phariſor.</hi> And thus ye now knowe, why my folkes not of their owne courteſie, but ſtraitly conſtrained thereto, take themſelues thus to their Gardes. Yea, would GOD it had coſte mée the halfe of mine Empire, that ſome good knight had ridde theſe Coſtes of hym. For I doubt me, that at the Iuſtes to morowe, he wil doe vs ſome miſchief, ſeyng he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to daie, for his wonted hower is paſt.</q> Care ye not (my Leige) ſaide the Youthe of the Fairies when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had done ſpeaking. For God who leaueth not anie wicked Act vnpuniſhed, will deliuer you well of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei haue dooen you, through his grace, guerdonyng theim accordyng to deſertes. If he ſette not hande thereto, ſaid the Emperour <q>(I feare me) it is vnpoſſible for any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main wight to vanquiſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this <hi>Ferclaſte</hi> who is the ſtrongeſt of them all, findeth not ſo hard yron, that with his ij. handes he eaſelie pulleth not in peeces, ſoner then one of vs, a Braunche or Sprig of a Tree: and carieth a Club ſo bigge and mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruous, that foure ſtrong men cannot lift it vp from the grounde: with whiche I beleeue there is not ſo ſure an Armour, nor ſo ſtiffe a ſhielde, but hee will with one ſtroake breake it to Pouder. And his brethren <hi>Ergoferant</hi> and <hi>Androfort,</hi> haue ſome whiles a battle Axe, ſo ſharpe and pearcing, that there is neither Yron nor Steele, of what
<pb facs="tcp:10374:54"/>hardnes ſoeuer, whiche flieth not in peeces at the attaiute therof: otherwhiles they carie eche of them the Clapers of twoo Belles, whiche they had brought into their Caue, from Sainte Peters Steeple of this Towne, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thinges that euer were ſeene, whiche they handle and weild, as well as one of vs would doe his Swerde: Briefly that is the moſte hideous thing to beholde, and horrible to heare, that euer was toulde or related.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So with ſuche and other like talke they paſſed away the tyme, vntill the Table was taken vp, and then after dinner the Youth ſeperated hym ſelfe ſo well as he could, from the other knightes, with whom he could haue beene content to haue talked more of the Grantes: of whom although they coulde hym marueilles, yet hee went to ſee his Squire at the Stable, where his Horſe and <hi>Geliaste</hi> was, whom hee founde both readie Sadled and Bridled. Beeyng harniſed with the good Armour whiche the Fairie had giuen hym, bee mounted vppon the good Steede <hi>Lycocephal,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaste</hi> vppon his, and ſo demaundyng the waie to Rocke Alpine, thei tooke on that waie, whiche was taught theim, leauyng them aſtoniſhed at their hardines, of whom they had demaunded the waie, ech one iudging that thei ment to trie ſome maiſtries with the Giantes. But <hi>Geliaſte,</hi> whom this game pleaſed not beſt, had no delite to give and ieſte as he was wont, but rather trembled for feare, ſeeing his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and hym drawe neere to the Denne of ſuche Giantes, ſaiyng to hym. <q>Alas Maiſter: why purpoſe you to go ſpill your ſelfe? whither is it, that you goe? or what will ye doe? woe is me, haue you no regarde of your ſelfe: what meane you to caſt your ſelf into the fire which wil aſſuredly hurne you? you haus heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in this Rocke Alpine are ſuche mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Giantes, as wil ſoone rente &amp; teare you in peeces, and yet goe you thither? But what thinke you to doe there? when as you well know, that thei haue deſtroyed and put to death an infinite number of ſo valiaunt Knightes, whiche
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10374:54"/>thither went, and neuer retourned.</q> Hold thy tongue, Beaſt (ſaide the Youth) for if they kill mee (as thou ſaieſt) I ſhall bee deliuered from the moſte miſerable tormente that euer poore wretch endured: and if I chaunce to vanquiſh them, I ſhal get both great renoume, &amp; alſo the Emperous fauour: &amp; poſſibly moreouer (which moſt I deſire) the good will of the Princeſſe <hi>Porphyria.</hi> And ſo I ſhal be exempte from my Paſſion, or at leaſt wiſe, ſomewhat eaſed: ſuppoſing by this little ſeruice, which I ſhall do her herein, that ſhe ſhall haue ſome occaſion to fauour mée, and to make more accompt of me then euer ſhe yet did. And if thou bee ſo affraide as thou makeſt ſemblant to be, thou maiſt hyde thee in ſome part of the Rocke, vntil ſuch time that thou ſeeſt me either vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher or va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giantes. The deuill take me if I hide me in their Rockes, ſaid <hi>Geliaſte,</hi> for if theſe monſters finde mee there, they will eate mée all vp at a Morſell: wherefore thinke not that I will euer leaue you. Doe therein as thou wilt, ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Youth. And with ſuch talke paſſed they the time, all the long waie, till they ariued in a certaine wood, which was not farre from the Rocke <hi>Alpine.</hi> Where in when they were entred a litle, they heard the voice of a Damozel, who complained ſorowfully. They ſtaiyng their Horſes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande what it was, apperceiued the fouleſt villayn that euer was ſeen, &amp; not ſo diffigured, but farre worſe apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For his cloathing was ſo rent and torne, that it ſhewed the one halfe of his fleſhe more filthy and blacke, then anie Colliar or Chimneiſweper of the Citie, which felow caried on his ſhoulders a ſacke ful of ſomwhat. Whom the Youth eſpiyng, remained more coy as well in that he heard again the former voice, as that he would alſo ſée whither the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt went: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at length he ſawe to reſt hymſelf neere to a greate Ditche, whiche was aboute the wood, and there ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his ſacke on the ground, he heard hym ſpeake in this wiſe, counterfaytyng his voyce. Madame, had you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee beloued of a braue and valiaunt Knight and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb facs="tcp:10374:55"/>who will take you to his ſpowſe and wife, if ſo you be pleaſed: then to ſuffer your ſelf, periſhe and die this raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For here now is the ditche wherin you muſt be drouned. Then heard he a voyce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſacke, whiche ſaid, yes willyngly: But I would faine ſee hym. Then the Villaine vnbindyng his Sacke whiche was of Tanned Leather, plucked out the headde of a braue Damozell, whiche was there within: who looking all about her, demaunded of him where the gentleman was that ſpake of her. Beholde here, Wenche (ſaied the Ruffian by hym ſelf) ſettyng his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des on his ſide brauely, and marchyng gallantly fiue or ſixe tymes aboute the Sacke: goe wicked Villaine ſaied the Damozell) I had rather bee diſmembred, by peicemeale, then that thy filthy fleſhe ſhould toutche myne. Scarſe had ſhe ſaied ſo, but the Villaine angrilie ſhut her againe in the Sacke, and was aboute to caſte her into the Ditche: when as the Youth hauyng ſeen all the matter, ranne to hym and ſtaied his purpoſe, ſaiyng. Raſcall, what is this that thou haſt in this Sacke? Sir. ſaied he. it is the Bolſter of an olde bed, whiche my Maiſter <hi>Ferclaſte</hi> hath bidden me to caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ditch, becauſe it is rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thou lieſt, ſaied the Youth, for me thought I ſawe a Damoſell, who becauſe ſhe would not condiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to thy filthy luſt, thou wouldeſt caſt into this Ditche. But ſir, you ſhall ſupply her rowme: and in ſteede of her, ende your vnhappie daies: and ſo takyng hym by the beard, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his Squire to vnlooſe the Lady from out of the ſacke, wherein he put the pernicious Peaſaunte, his head dounewardes, and ſo caſte hym into the Ditche: whiche doen, he demaunded of the Damozel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence ſhe was: and why they would haue drouned her? Whereto ſhe anſwered and ſaid. Worthy ſir I am daughter to one of the Emperors knightes: who was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie yeſternight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the cittie by the Giant <hi>Ferclaste,</hi> to whoſe diſordinate luſt, becauſe I would not willyngly obaie, he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this villaine on this wiſe to make me away: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10374:55"/>you haue ſaued me, and therof I hartely thanke you. And if it maie pleaſe you, to go with me to my fathers houſe in the cittie, he will for your happie deliueryng of me, reward you to his power, although not accordyng to your deſeruyngs. For well I knowe, that he is ſorrowfull for my ſake. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozell (ſaied the Knight) of Guerdon for your deliuerie I ſmally care, ſeyng that therein I haue doen but my duetie, whiche is to ſuccour Ladie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But take ye heede that ye neither kill hym nor his Horſe, for he ſeemeth faire and good, and I beleue he would carry mee verie well, and we wil burne the other quicke, or make hym die cruellie. Verely (ſaied <hi>Androfort</hi>) you ſpeake well, for he hath truely deſerued it, and my ſelfe will take paines to puniſhe hym with myne owne handes, and you ſhall haue his Horſe for your parte: whiche if hee cannot beare you, I feare mee none elles will, and my Brother <hi>Ergoferarnt</hi> ſhall haue his Shield, for it is ſo good, that our folkes could in no wiſe endamage nor perce it with their Dartes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.

And how is he called? ſaide the Knighte. he hath to name, maiſter Rabalon, aunſwered they againe.

For againſt his will I meane not to conſtraine hym to doe any thing. I thinke well (ſaid one of the companie) that he would rather bee with you, then with the Giantes: for they tooke hym perforce from the Emperour, beecauſe of his greate cunning, and haue dealt with hym verie vncour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly. And in ſo ſaiyng, they arriued in the Rocke, whiche was finely cut &amp; carued within like vnto a Pallace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Youth was greatly aſtonied. For there were Halles, Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, Wardropes both hie &amp; lowe made, by great ſkill and induſtrie, whiche the Giantes had founded not longe afore, when with their huyge force, they had hollowed the Rocke, which was meruellous hard, to kéepe them in more ſafetie: and therein none entred but by one onely Gate, although within, were more then ſixtie, as well of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as priſons, which all were ſhut vp with mighty keies. The whiche the knight tooke as ſoone as he was entered, hauyng found them vppon a Table, tyed all together with an huyge Chaine of yron, which the Porter had left there, fearing that the knight aſking for him, and being informed
<pb facs="tcp:10374:62"/>of his wickedneſſe and crueltie towardes the Priſoners, woulde rewarde hym according to his deſertes, like as his Maiſters were: and therefore hid he himſelf, in a Vaſte and darkeſome caue, vnder a Tunne where he was ſmothered. and ſo hee ended his wicked life. But hee ſoone founde the good Chirurgian Maiſter Rabalon: who at the entrie of the doore crooched doune humbly on his knée, to deſire him of Pardon. The Youth taking him by the hande, made him ſtande vp, ſaiyng: <q>I will not pardon thee: for why, thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offendedſt mee, and therefore thou haſt no neede to aſke mercie, but for this that I heare ſaie, that thou haſt apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the good Emperour of Conſtantinople, towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des whom it is expedient that thou goe to impertrate that, whiche thou requireſt of mee, for the offence that thou haſt wrought, in beeyng ſo long abſent from his companie, to ſerue ſuche miſchiuous Tyrauntes as thou haſt doen here: and I will that from mee, thou do preſent &amp; ſhew theſe dead Giauntes and knightes, beyng layde vppon ſome Chariot, to his Maieſtie. For I wotte well, that knowing of their deſtruction, he will be muche ioyous, conſideryng the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde annoyes whiche they haue ſtill wrought hym: &amp; in thy companie ſhall goe all the Priſoners whiche are within, to thanke (for their deliuerie) the faire Princeſſe <hi>Porphyrie</hi> his Daughter after humble ſalutations to her done on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: for ſhe alone is the cauſe hereof. And if ſhe do enquire who hath done it, tell thou her that it was the Youthe of the Fairies, the leaſte of her Seruitours (if for one ſhe will accepte hym) though farre vnworthy of ſuche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</q> Then gaue he him the keyes to go deliuer the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, but ſeeing hym to be ſomewhat wounded, firſte hee gaue him ſome of his Oyntmentes to his ſore: whiche had ſuche ſpeedy operation, becauſe the wound was not greate, that the next mornyng it was whole and ſounde. But why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he was thus appliyng his Medicine, hee ſawe the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes (whom he had pardoned, and who ſtoode without) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10374:62"/>fearefully, tremblyng and quaking to hyde them ſelues here and there with greate diligence. Whereat the Youth lacing his Helmet and taking his Shield and Swerde, ſet forwarde out of the Gate to ſee what was happened: and he apperceiued the Giaunte <hi>Ergoferant</hi> to come that waie (for he had not quite killed hym as the others were, but onelie amazed hym with a blow vppon his head) who beyng come againe to hym ſelfe, hauing caſt awaie his Battell Axe, and left of his Helmet, Shield &amp; Iacke, &amp; ſeeyng his brethren dead, came and proſtrated hymſelfe at the Knightes feete (whom he founde with Swerde and Target in hande rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) crauing hym humbly of Pardon. The Youth who was right mercifull, ſeeyng hym (contrary to thoſe of his kind) ſo meeke, fréely pardoned hym, conditionally (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng) that he ſhould goe with the reſt of the Priſoners the morow followyng, to aſke Pardon of the Emperour, for the harmes which he had done him, and to thanke the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Porphyria</hi> for his life ſo ſaued, &amp; to preſente to her his ſeruice, doyng ſtill what ſhe ſhould appoint hym, wherto he gladly condiſcended: and thereupon hee commaunded hym to ſet free the Priſoners and to aſke theim forgeuenes for the damage whiche hee had long done vnto theim, whiche thing he did. Immediatly he tooke the keyes whiche Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Rabalon had in his hande, and went to deliuer the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who ſeing him, thought what he had come for ſome other purpoſe. But much were they amerueiled, when they ſaw hym kneele doune before them, aſkyng theim forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, praiyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the loue of hym which was cauſe of their deliueraunce, and who had pardoned hym, it would pleaſe them alſo to vſe the like courteſie towardes hym: whereto they willingly agreed, for that this ſame Giant (as it were quite contrarie in nature and diſpoſition to his brethren) had afore tyme bene cauſe that they were well vſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated: for he was full courteous and pitifull, wherefore he ledde them towardes the Youthe, whom they humbly than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

Who geuing hym thankes therefore

In no wiſe was it for your entrie (whiche hath been too damageable and hurtful for vs, yea, that euer you came hether) that the pompe and magnificencie (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you haue been brought thus farre) hath been prepared: but rather for one of them, whom you vaunte to haue ſlain, whereof if I were aſſured, I promiſe you, you ſhould neuer paſſe my Palliace, but that your cruell carkaſſe ſhould bee cutte and chopte in peeces, to ſerue therewith the Crowes and Rauens. But doubtleſſe, the beginning of his deedes, &amp; feates of Armes ſoner acertaine me, that if you haue ſlaine hym as you ſaie, or rather robbed hym of his Harneſſe, and Horſe (as well it maie bee) it was ſurely when he was a ſlepe.

Whiche thing the Emperour ſeeyng, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the other to ceaſe, who as then buſely beganne to aſſaile hym mortally on all ſides, blaming and reprehending them ſharply for being ſo raſh, in outraging a knight vnknowen, in his preſence, and vncommaunded: who acknowledgyng their fault, retired and ceaſed the conflict, leauing the yong vncoth Knight ſo boyling in yre and deſpite, that it paſſed. Suche was his ſtomacke enflamed with griefe and anger, that if he had had them before him in the fielde, they had not eſcaped with the loſſe of ſo fewe as they did, neither could he but ſpeake theſe outragious wordes to the Emperour. <q>Knowe (ſaied he) thou Emperour of Conſtantinople, that thou haſte miſuſed in thy Courte, the Sonne of one of the moſte puiſſaunt and valiaunteſt Kinges of the Earthe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that with his perſon he hath done thee ſo much fauour, (thou not any waie deſeruyng it) as to come honour and beautifie thy Court: who is of power with the ayde of his frendes, not onely to take vengeaunce of thee and thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for this outragious facte, in deſtroying thine Empyre: but alſo to bring in ſubiection vnto him at his pleaſure, the

But after that the bloud of the Emperour, whiche through chafed Choler vrged him to this anger, was cooled, and that he had giuen ſome releaſe to his griefe, he much repented hym, ſo to haue vſed the vnknowen knight aſwell for the greate vertue and proweſſe which he eſteemed to be in hym, as that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode he was a Chriſten kinges Sonne: and reputed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for ſo foule a fact committed in his Court, indigne and not worthy any more to weare Imperiall Crowne vppon his head, or to beare Scepter. Neuertheleſſe ponderyng vppon the vehemente Paſſion and iuſte occaſion whiche had moued him thereunto, he chaunged opinion, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain blamed his Meynie for being ſo bold in this attempt.

But tell me I praie thee <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaste,</hi> why thou thus ſpeakeſt, ſaid the Youth: or vpon what occaſion? for I can neuer remember that I was wounded of any perſon, but of the Giaunt <hi>Ergoferant,</hi> when I fought againſt hym, muche leſſe ſlayne: then how can this be? Alſo I meruell very greatly, in that thou ſaieſt my deare frende <hi>Phariſor</hi> is dead. Then did the Squire recount vnto hym, (from point to point) all the ſucceſſe of the aduentures paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the day before, as is aforeſaied:</q> whereat the Youth was toſſed with extreeme dolour, hauyng intelligence of <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> death, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the Squire to bring hym where he yet laie, whereto, (they beyng both mounted on horſe) he failed not to obaie. But when they were ariued to the place where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> combat had bene atchiued, they were much ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they could not finde his corps, to bury &amp; Entombe it honourably, as to the greatnes of his birth, but chiefly to his great vertue and valiauncie, apperteined. They founde the place where he had laine long all bleedyng and bloudy, which alſo was couered with many litle peeces of his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which moued the Youth to ſuche compaſſion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng attainted in harte with an inſupportable dolour and diſtreſſe which ſodainly at the ſight thereof ſurpryſed him, it lacked little that hee had not then and there fullye ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the place: and I thinke that if his magnanimitie and hartie valiauncie could haue giuen place in greatenes and force, to his extreeme dolour, hee had done it. So ſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had he emprinted the vehement amitie that hee bare, to that man in his hearte, hauyng beene in his companie,
<pb facs="tcp:10374:89"/>but thrée or fower daies: aſwell for the proweſſe and vertue, wherewith hee was enriched aboue all others, as for the ſinguler courteſie and frendſhippe which ſo ſhined in them both alike, that they almoſt ſeemed both one body, bente to one courſe of kinde. But ſupportyng the moſt pacientlie he could, his extreeme dole and ſorowe, he did as then nought els, but weepe and bewayle hym ſo lamentablie, that dole and ſorow themſelues could not ſurpaſſe hym in ſighes and teares, whiche ranne like ruſhyng Riuers doune his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chéekes: which to declare I muſt take a briefer courſe: tellyng only how aſſone as he could haue any ſtaie of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, he made vowe and ſware neuer to reſt in place, clymat or countrie, till he had found out the Knight which had ſlaine hym, to reuenge his death, although in deede hee were ſhortlie after as ſounde and luſtie as euer hee was.

And to encreaſe their number alſo, came there a while after to their helpe kyng <hi>Tawladas</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight of the Ile of <hi>Canada,</hi> and fierce <hi>Guydard</hi> of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleos,</hi> with either of theim an Armie of more then thirtie thouſande fightyng men, mounted on mightie Horſes and Elephantes whiche caried euery one fiue or ſixe men well furniſhed with ſhot in the little Caſtles of wood, which that had vppon their backes: whiche two in force and proweſſe were nothyng leſſe then <hi>Bruniſſant</hi> &amp; <hi>Sallazard,</hi> whoſe ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce and confederauncie to haue, they came to this match, and alſo to trie the force and valiauncie of kyng <hi>Florida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> and his Brytiſhe knightes, whether they were corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the fame that went vpon them or naye.</p>
               <p>And on this wiſe this puiſſaunt armie beeyng aſſembled in Corne waile, and the Countrie thereaboutes, they made not long delaie, but embarked theym ſelues to paſſe into
<pb facs="tcp:10374:95"/>greate Brittaine: and in what magnificent order you ſhall vnderſtande. Firſt there wente before, eightie greate Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leis wandryng on the mayne Sea with Sealecloathes ſpread, and aboundaunce of Dares, marchyng like a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſte: neither met they any veſſel on the Seas, whatſoeuer, but thei drowned it: and they went ten and ten in a Rancke Quadrangle wiſe, and not one ſwifter any whit then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Alſo there were fiftene great Carrickes, which went before the Gallies about a mile or leſſe: and at euery ſide of the Quadrangle Galley fleete, was alſo ten, wherein were the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> who at this daie are called <hi>Biſkaynes,</hi> a People neere to Spaine, who were conducted thether by their Kynge <hi>Marton,</hi> whiche in Sea matters was moſte ſkilfull, and was ordained Admirall generall, of all the Army by the other kynges apoyntmentes: from whom he was ſeparated, and came in a Galley, which marched alone amongeſt the foreſaied fleete, and a greate Troupe of Foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, Boates and Brigandines, whiche in number amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to moe then ſixe ſcore, whiche followed after: whiche Galley exceeded all the reſt in bignes, in beauty &amp; in braue araie: for the men of the ſame were all araide in Caſſockes and Bonnets of Ueluet, half greene &amp; halfe blewe, rowyng the Dares: to euerie one of whiche (beeyng fifty on a ſide painted all red) there were ten ſet, all tyed by the Legges with great Chaynes of ſiluer. And moreouer the couerture of the place where was <hi>Martons</hi> Chamber, was alſo all of Siluer, wrought with ſpangles and leaues of Golde, and Azure moſt rich &amp; ſumptuous, on the top wherof appeered a mightie ſhakyng Enſeigne, wherin was painted a great. Sea Monſter, muche reſemblyng a Crocodile all mailed with Scales of greene, and the Enſigne was blewe: about the which was written in Golden Letters this ſame Verſe or ſaiyng, <hi>Vpon the Seas I all deſtroye: for none I meete may mee annoye.</hi> And a little lower was written <hi>Marton, <hi>the Terrour of the Waues:</hi>
                  </hi> neither was there place in all this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10374:95"/>Galley aſwell vppon the Hatches, as Roapes and Cordes whiche held the Maſt: but that there was ſuche a like Enſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne (either little or greate) tyed, to euery one of which was faſtened an infinite number of Cimbales, and Siluer Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whiche ſhaken with the Winde, yelded a merueilous ſweete harmony.</p>
               <p>After this magnificent Galley, that went without either rule or certaine order, diſperſed here and there aboute the winges of the Sea fleete, theſe foreſaied ſixe and twentie Foiſtes, Galliottes, Gallions, and Brigantines: In the greateſt of the whiche Foiſtes, were the kynges <hi>Tauladas</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> and <hi>Guytard</hi> of <hi>Baccaleos,</hi> with their Horſemen, and the Elephauntes whiche thei had brought, beeyng in thirtie greate Shippes, whiche followed after marueilou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie well ordered, with ſaile diſplaied, &amp; top and top gallant braue to beholde: wherin was a great noyce of Drummes, Fites, Trumpettes, and other inſtrumentes of Warre, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne &amp; hideous to behold. Finally, after all theſe foreſaied veſſelles, came a Fléete of twoo hundred Shippes or more, and ſome Barkes, which marched all in order triangled, in forefronte of the whiche, thers was one Ship, farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fairer then the reſte, whiche cutte the Seas with ſuche celeritie and ſwifteneſſe, as was poſſible to beholde: and therein were kyng <hi>Grandowine, Angraforte, Bruniſſant, Barant, Salazard, Zorlot</hi> and their brethren <hi>Cambarel</hi> and <hi>Phagatroffe,</hi> which haſtened to aduertiſe kyng <hi>Marton,</hi> to take order how to draw a little ſideward, to aſſaile a certain Fleete of ſhippes, which they had diſcried in the maine ſea, goyng ſtreight to greate Britaigne there to take Hauen, and ſo to make them captiues, if thei would not yelde to bée on his parte. But as thei were thus buſied to giue order hereunto, and to ſet their thynges in a readineſſe, beholde they were all aſtoniſhed on the ſodaine, by the Carrickes, &amp; Galleis which went ſtill before, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were met, &amp; the folkes therein aſſaulted, &amp; many putte to death by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:10374:96"/>ther Fleete (whiche came a bywaie with a marueilous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritie) whoſe number was aboute fiftie fiue, or ſixtie braue Shippes of Warre: whiche fiercelie enteryng here and there aundde the greate troupe of Galleis (whereof thei o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrewe and burned many with Fires artificiall, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtrumentes of Warre) thei made at the firſte a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous Martyrdome of the accurſed Painims therein. For they were not a whit afraied of this encounter: which thyng the Admirall <hi>Marton</hi> ſeeyng, cauſed incontinentlie his great Galley to prepare her ſelf with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to come and aide at this pinch, &amp; alſo a number of the Foiſtes &amp; Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandines whiche came after: all which with ſpede haſtened to aſſault the little fleete. When the Capitaine of the ſame, (foreſeyng what daunger he was in) would faine haue reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fled, but that the other fleete, who (as I ſaide before, was firſte diſcouered of Paynims, ioyned powers thereto: and ſo recuilyng and muſteryng ſomewhat together, they behaued themſelues ſo well, that more then twentie of the Paynims Foyſtes and Galleis were ſounke and burned. For in the Shippe whiche was Admiralle, there were two braue Knightes, whiche commaunded all the Armie: who ſet in araie with their Swordes in their handes, and braſen ſhieldes preſt for their better defence, raged in their enterpriſe, and with furie couloured the bellye of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Thetis,</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of thoſe accurſed Painims. Nay, they caught none, but they ſente hym to ſeeke hym ſelfe in the bottom of the waues, where he might drinke his laſte, or els to taſt of death on the Hatches: whiche thing the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt Kyng <hi>Marton</hi> ſeeyng (who raged to ſee ſo manie of his men ſlaine by two knightes) addreſſed his Galley that waie, &amp; ioynyng with one of the Knightes, who bare in his ſhielde a Dragon of Azure, in a fielde of Sables, for cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaunce, was there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt daungerous Skirmiſhe betwene them that euer was heard of. For Kyng <hi>Marton</hi> (who was exceedyng ſtrong) thinkyng with his fierce lookes to haue
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10374:96"/>fraied and made flee thoſe twoo doughtie Captaynes, was muche aſtoniſhed when he founde hymſelfe ſo matched with the one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in all his life he neuer had bene ſo troubled, in ſo muche that he thought there to haue loſt his life preſently: ſuche were the blowes whiche he receiued at the knightes handes of the Dragon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had it not bene for the enchaunted Helmet whiche he beare, it had beene doubtfull whether he ſhould haue retorned ſound as he did. But becauſe hee was armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Harneſſe wholy ſo enchaunted, that neither ſword nor other weapon whatſoeuer, could pearce or cut, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted well more, then an hower againſt his aduerſarie, who alſo defended hymſelf valiauntlie as (God knowes) he had neede: for both of them were ſtrong, valiaunte and ſkilfull in Armes. True it is, that if Kyng <hi>Marton</hi> exceeded hym ſomewhat in force, hee againe counterueiled it in agillitie and nimblenes of bodie, and in craft of Skirmiſhyng, as wel appeared by him in this mutual combat. But the other to counterueile all that, gaue hym now and then ſuch grene atteintes, that the red bloud began alreadie in ſome places to runne doune his body: but for al that, neuer made he any ſemblaunce of griefe, to condemne hym ſelf of Cowardyſe. But as the Beare and the wilde Boare beyng enuenomed one againſt another, ſtryue ſtill with rage to pull eche other in peeces: ſo theſe twoo valiaunt Champions did all their powers to depriue eche other of life, although the one had ſmall aduauntage of the other: whiche made them maruell much of their owne proweſſes, ſtill paiyng eche other as the Smith with an heauy Hammer doth his Anuild often: and as the one his Harneſſe, ſo did the others nimblenes kéepe them both aliue long</p>
               <p>And thus endured the Combate a greate while, duryng whiche, the Knight of the Dragon his fellowe ruſhed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Paynims (of whom he made a merueilous but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therie and ſlaughter) and with his Meyny behaued himſelf ſo well, that many were ſlaine, and a multitude drowned,
<pb facs="tcp:10374:97"/>neither coaped he with any, but hee loſte either Leg, Arme, ſhoulder, Necke, or ſome parte of his body, alwaies hauyng a ſoueraine care to ſaue his owne Ships notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: whereunto after a while all his men reentered by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. For ſéeing the reſt of the aduerſaries Veſſels at hande, whiche Kyng <hi>Grandowyne</hi> and his twoo Sonnes led (whom if they had taried, they had bene all diſcomfited) they hoyſt vp ſailes, and moued Dares to departe with all ſpeede, contenting them ſelues with the honour which they had gotten in reſiſting ſo many with ſo ſmal a power, to the great damage and ruine of their Enemies, and yet looſing a very few of their owne party: neither any veſſell, but that wherein was the knight of the Dragon, who whiles hys men prepared them ſelues to gayne the North, kepte <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> plaie ſtill: to whom (ſeeyng then readie to departe) hee gaue ſuche ablowe with his Sworde on the head, that hee made hym fall on his knees, ſo aſtoniſhed, that he knew not where he was: and then taking a little Boate, whiche was ſwiftlie furniſhed with Sailes and Mariners, hee retyred with the reſt of his Armie awaie from his aduerſaries, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng them agreeued at this encountrie: who not knowyng how to be reuenged, ſet fire on that great ſhippe, whom hee had lefte them. For as it was better, they thought it good rather to retyre with that gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> victory, then with daunger to attend the comyng of the reſt of the Army, to their great ouerthrowe and confuſion: a thyng rather to be reputed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhenes of them, then hardines.</p>
               <p>Although the Paynims thought verely to haue gotten the honour through their flight. Who taking their voyage towarde greate Brittayne, tooke Porte a while after, at the Cittie of London, where as then laye the good Kynge <hi>Floridamant:</hi> who with a greate Troupe of his Barons and Lordes wente to welcome thoſe twoo valiaunt Knightes, which ſo had vſed the Paynims: whom he a farre of knewe (by the enſignes hanged on the Maſtes of their ſhippes) to

For you muſt note, that the Noble kyng of greate Brittaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng certified of the waſte and iniurie whiche kyng <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſant</hi> had made, in goyng through his Realme, perceiued well that hee went toward his Father the kyng of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle, who prepared againſt hym a mightie Hoaſte, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the death of his two other Children, whom hee had put to death. And beyng aduertized of the greate force and puiſſaunce wherewith he came againſt hym. And doubting hym ſelfe not able to reſiſte ſo greate an Armie had ſente Ambaſſadours on all ſides to the kinges his Neighbours, to deſire their ayde, and chiefly to theſe two his Subiectes, who failed not herein to come: And by the waye knowyng that the Paynims were not farre from them, they had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Armie in twoo, to embuſhe and aſſaile theym (as you haue afore heard) to their great ruine and decaie. Who a while after theim, came to take Lande before the Cittie of London: from whence after a long and a ſharpe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, they were expulſed and driuen backe, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to caſte Ancour elſewhere, aboute a Myle from the Cittie, where Maugre the Chriſtians they deſcended: as I meane to ſhewe you in the firſte Chapter of my nexte booke, God willing, with the reſt of their Battels and diſcomfitures.</p>

               <p>Immediatelie after this Saracen had belched out theſe woordes out of his malicious mouthe, and ſtinkyng ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, all the other Pagan kynges ſaied with one voice, that he had ſpoken paſſyng well, and that it behoued hym to deliberate foorthwith, to whiche of theim the charge of ſcalyng the walles, and entryng the Citee ſhould bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: with whom ſhould an hundred thouſande footemen accompaignie, to make ſhorte woorke in the aſſaulte, and to open the gates the ſoner, that the kynges and knightes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainyng without the walles, might enter at their eaſe without reſiſtaunce. And after the matter was throughlie ranuaſed emong theim, the puiſſaunt kyng <hi>Guitard</hi> of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleos</hi> was appointed to vndertake the charge.

                  <q>This night paſſed, as I ſoundly ſlept, mée thought.

All whiche well mounted, marched together in one Troupe againſte the enemie, garded on the one ſide with Duke <hi>Candior</hi> of Normandie, and his Sonne <hi>Don Siluan,</hi> Earle of Flaunders, who was a verie young knight, but well eſtéemed for Feates of Armes.

<pb facs="tcp:10374:102"/>the retyryng, but that three thouſand fell doune ſtarke dead in the place. Whereof the kyng of <hi>Baccaleos,</hi> (as hee ſtoode on the walles encouragyng his men to clyme vp apace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng aduertized,) deſcended from thence, and came inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neutly with a truſtie bande of his ſtouteſt knightes, among whom there was one braue Sarazin, of mightie ſtrength, named <hi>Micophron,</hi> that was his Couſin. As ſoone as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooched néere the place, and ſawe what hauocke the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians made of the Pagans, hee was almoſt mad with rage and ſpite, to ſee his people ſo diſordred and ſlaine: whom he met ſléeing, being chaſed by the knightes aboue named: and with maine force entered into the Croude on foote as hee was, being followed of his people: who viewyng his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, tooke heart agrace, laying about them with all their might, in ſuche wiſe, that if God had not taken compaſſion vpon the poore Chriſtians, there had not one eſcaped that day: for he encountered nothing in that place, whiche hee did not hewe in peeces: next vnto hym the fierce Sarazin <hi>Micophron</hi> made ſuch a terrible ſlaughter and ſpoyle of the poore Chriſtians, that none there were, that durſt withſtand hym, for feare leſt they ſhould be ſente to their long homes. And aſſuredly they had ouercome the whole Cittie, if that the renoumed kynge <hi>Floridamant,</hi> the valiaunt <hi>Ferrande</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Don Murcibel</hi> of Denmarke, (whoſe ſtrength by Gods diuine power, I beleue was then redoubled) had not in tyme haſted to the ſuccour of their people. But theſe noble Princes beholdyng this miſerable ſpectacle, vſed wonderfull diligence and celeritie, and bare them ſelues ſo valiauntly, that king <hi>Floridamant</hi> coaping with the king of <hi>Baccaleos, Don Ferrand</hi> with <hi>Mycophron</hi> the ſtrong, and <hi>Murcibell</hi> among the other Pagans, ſmytyng before and behinde, and on both ſides, compelled them after an harde and ſharpe conflict, to tourne their backes, and ſhewe their heeles. For kyng <hi>Floridamant</hi> ſurpriſed with furie, and chafed in fightyng, raught kyng <hi>Guitard</hi> with all his force,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10374:102"/>ſuche a violent ſtroake, that he made his Helmet flee of his head, and had ſlaine him without doubt, if his people had not the more ſpeedely ſuccoured hym: but perceiuing his head vnarmed, hee retyred haſtely to the place from whence hee came, hauyng receiued no other hurte but, that, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the blowe, his eyes ſo ſparkeled, that for a quarter of an hower after, he could ſee verie little at all: and it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectured, that had it not bene for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnes of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, being that, which <hi>Achilles</hi> did weare, at the bataile of Troy, when he ſlewe the valiaunt <hi>Hector,</hi> doubtles he had not bene left aliue: howbeit he was afterward much vexed, yea &amp; ready to runne out of his wittes, for that parte of the Armour whiche he had loſte, hauyng wonne them from the ſtrong <hi>Bagellan,</hi> king of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> by Combate enduring thrée daies continually: whiche <hi>Bagellan</hi> receiued them from his Aunceſtour <hi>

               <p>But now to goe forward in the recitall of the reſt of this hideous hurlie burlie, betwene the Painims and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: you ſhall vnderſtande, that after kyng <hi>Guitard</hi> with the loſſe of his armour, was ſo eſcaped out of the tumulte, mightie <hi>Mycophron</hi> his couſin, whom he had left behinde in the Briers, with muche adoe and difficultie, ſuſtained the brunte of his enemies, beyng welnigh ouercome by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailers of hym: for he was ſo roughly charged and purſued, by the three Chriſtian kynges, that notwithſtandyng his manfull and couragious defence, hee was taken Priſoner. For he had once before brought kyng <hi>Ferrand</hi> of Norwaie, to ſo harde an exigent, for all his excellent proweſſe, that he had not long endured againſt hym, had not the kynges, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridamant</hi> and <hi>Murcibell</hi> afforded their aides: who chargyng the Pagans as aforeſaid, forced hym to yelde himſelf priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; in reſpect of his valiauncie, ſlewe hym as they did his people, who were entered into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citee: of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made ſuche hauocke, that not one remained vnſlaine, to cary newes of

               <p>Thus you maie perceiue how noblie the three Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kynges in thoſe partes behaued them ſelues, from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, till the Sunne was welnigh ſette: It remaineth that we make rehearſal, what was done on the other ſide againſt cruell <hi>Angrofolt</hi> and thoſe monſtrous Giantes, <hi>Briſard</hi> and <hi>Rogemont,</hi> by the reſidue of the twelue valiaunte knightes of Greate Britaigne: who beeyng in other quarters of the Citee, and hearyng the noiſe and Alarme of their enemies, who had made enteraunce in greate multitudes, vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducte of the ſame <hi>Angrofolt,</hi> accompanied with theſe twoo Giauntes, marched on in marueilous haſte thetherwarde, beeyng aſſiſted by the more parte of the garriſons of the citee, with ſuche diligence and dexteritie, that the Pagans being not farre entered into the Citie, were by them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to recuyle vnto the very walles, not without great loſſe and ſlaughter. How as the Giauntes were entered with <hi>Angrofolt</hi> their Lorde, be ſeeyng the reſiſtaunce that they of the Citee made, commaunded theſe twoo Butcherlie Giauntes to ſuccour their menne: hym ſelf onely takyng ware to the kinges Pallace, to ſeaze vpon his deſired praie: beyng the Lady <hi>Polydamie,</hi> who as then kepte her ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her Chamber, lamentyng and weepyng, with noble Queene <hi>Belizenne</hi> her Mother, who made pitifull moane, meenyng her totall ruine to be at hand.

Foorthwith kyng <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridamant</hi> meanyng to purſue hym, and to fighte with hym hande to hand, commaunded the kynges <hi>Ferrand,</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibell,</hi> to haſte theim to the aide of his knightes, and in the purſuite of the Pagan (as one that was more nimble and actiue) demeaned hym ſelf ſo well, that in a narrowe Lane, where the other reſted to breath hymſelf, he ouertooke him: who ſeeyng none other to followe ſaue the kyng, reioyſed greately, and takyng his Sworde in his hande, and his Shield on his arme, attended, vaunting on foote to receiue the onſett, howbeit to his no ſmall preiudice. For the kyng cloſely bucklyng with hym, aſſailed hym with ſuche force and violence, that had not his Enchaunted Armes ſerued hym at that pinch, he ſhould haue been ſoone diſpatched, but by the helpe of theim, he continued the fight more then an hower and an halfe, wherein ſuche manhoode was ſhewed by the aſſailant and defendant, that it was harde to diſcerne who had the better or worſe, till at laſte twoo howers after the Battaile begonne drawyng on, the Pagan becauſe of his feebleneſſe and faineneſſe, beeyng vnable to endure any longer, fell doune in a ſoune on the Earth: the Kyng part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking the aduauntage, although hee was weried in the Combate, ſet his foote vpon his breaſt, and hauyng taken of his Helmet, entended to haue ſlaine hym, when the other who had recouered hym ſelfe, cried: <q>O Noble Kyng, for Gods ſake ſpare my life, and at this inſtaunt extende I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéeche you, that exceedyng mercie and clemencie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I haue hearde you alwaies renoumed: ſince that by my death you ſhall not purchaſe ſo greate honour, hauyng now no meanes to defende my ſelfe.</q> The king the mirrour of courteſie &amp; pitie, ſhewed himſelf towards this cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt ſo mercifull, that hee did hym no other harme, ſaue onely made hym his Priſoner, wherewith the Pagan was
<pb facs="tcp:10374:104"/>partly comforted. The chief conductor of the Pagans, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng rendered hymſelfe vanquiſhed, was by Kyng <hi>Florida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> brought vnarmed, to the place where the Chriſtians and Heathen people fiercely fought: ſo that they iſſue to what ſide the victorie was more likely to encline, ſeemed vncertaine and doubtfull: when as kyng <hi>Floridamant,</hi> who made more accompt of the life of his men, then of the death of a thouſand of his foes, on the one ſide, and <hi>Angrafolt</hi> his Priſoner on the other ſide, cauſed theym to ſurceaſſe. The force of the Heatheniſhe reſted principally in <hi>Brizard</hi> and <hi>Rogemont</hi> the Giauntes, who made greate ſpoyle and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke among the Chriſtians, and had taken vp and caried awaie vnder their Armes (as though they had beene Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens or Capons) fower of the couragious Knightes of great Britaine, to witte <hi>Don Acciall</hi> of Surrey, &amp; <hi>Ramelin</hi> of the Ile of Wight by <hi>Briſard, Melchior</hi> of Irelande and the Earle of Durford, by the fell <hi>Rogement:</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng were rendered, and the Pagans chieftaines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to retyre with thoſe fewe that remained on liue: for of fiftie thouſande Pagans that by ſcalyng the walles, had entered: ſcarſe twentie thouſande were left one liue: and of Chriſtians aboute fifteene thouſande were founde dead, as well of Women and Children, as of men of baſe condition, that with Weapons, Stones, and ſuche like, ranne vppon their enemies. Howbeit no knight of name was ſlaine, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the valiant <hi>Heroald,</hi> who was found among the preſſe almoſt ſmothered, and the young <hi>Don Siluan</hi> of Flaunders, who had all that daie fought againſt the cruell Giaunt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemont,</hi> and by a wounde whiche he receiued in his Arme, loſt ſo muche bloud, that if he had not been helped in tyme, he had beene in daunger to be loſt: but as it fortuned, hee ſuffered no other hurte, ſaue the paine of his wound, which ſhortly after was cured, as we finde in the auncient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of <hi>Gallarx</hi> the Hiſtoriographer: who for that he ſurceaſeth to entreate any further, touchyng theſe affaires

Wherfore aſſone as the obſcuritie of the night beganne to dyminiſhe, ſeeyng neither his minde nor body by concourſe of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate pangues and amourous cogitations, no diſpoſed to quietnes, he leapeth out of bed, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was very cloudie &amp; darke: when as his Eſquier, who ſteapte, not knowyng with what conceipt his maiſter was tickeled, likewiſe left his bed, and makyng hymſelfe readie, fayled not forthwith to haſte vnto the ſtable, there to ſaddle and bridle his Horſe, and to prepare all other thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for his Maiſter when he ſhould take Horſe: diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the ſame with ſuche diligence, that nothyng lacked when his Maiſter beyng armed came. Who accompanied with his Hoſte, departed with all ſpeede, to ouertake the perſon whiche he ſought for: trauailyng ſo faſt, that before the dawnyng of the daie, they arriued at <hi>Byzaunce.</hi> Where takyng leaue of his Hoaſt, whom he ſatiſfied to his conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he embarked hym ſelfe in a Shippe well furniſhed, whom he founde preſt to make voyage towardes Fraunce: for that hee hauyng enquired of the vnknowen knight, the Maiſter of the ſhippe had tolde hym, that the Euenyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame knight had taken Shippe in a Barcke, of a Companion of his, that ſailed thetherwarde: whereof hee was not a little ioyfull, commaundyng the Sea man with all expedition, to hoiſe vp the Sailes and away: ſo that thei paſſed along the meane Seas, the ſpace of twoo daies and a night: at the expiration whereof the Sailer in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, perceiuing the ſunne to appeare redde of coulour, and the windes to blowe bluſteryngly, alteryng the calmenes of the weather, and ſtilnes of the waues, into a troubleſome and tempeſtuous rage, would haue declined out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10374:105"/>courſe, and bente his ſhippe towardes a little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, lying far diſtaunt from the ready way into Fraunce. The Youth of the Fairies ſuſpectyng no leſſe, gaue hym in charge both earneſtly &amp; halfe diſpleaſauntly, that he ſhould ſaile directly on. For (quoth he) fall backe, fall edge, no hap ſo hard, no, nor feare of death, during the ſafety of this Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſhall inforce mee to chaunge my purpoſe. The diſcrete Sailer knowyng the will of the Knight to bee conſtantlie ſettled to abyde the vttermoſte that the wrathfull Skies mought threaten, or frowarde fortune procure, as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſuffer pacientlie whatſoeuer diſtreſſe it woulde pleaſe the almightie to throwe hym in, would not gaineſay hym: for the ſmall experience whiche ſo ſhort time could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him of his worthines, bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, &amp; comely qualities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Youth was adorned, had perſwaded hym ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his mynde to pleaſe and ſerue hym, that he woulde in no wiſe withſtande his commaundement: howbeit, becauſe he ſaw the imminent ieoperdie of their liues nowe approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, for to aſſaie whether by any perſuaſions hee mought tourne his opinion, he tolde hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had perceiued certain vſuall ſignes, betokenyng alwaies ſome miſchaunce and violent tempeſt, as the high and ſodaine towring of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: whiche, Syr (ſaieth hee) maketh mee to miſtruſte that with no aſſayling, but with greate daunger of oure ruine, wee maye paſſe any further. Moreouer the continuall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Dolphins aboue water, which I eſpie, abaſheth &amp; warneth mée to auoyde the perillous outrage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winds and weather. Wherefore I thinke it verie expedient, that we ſoiourne in ſome ſurer harbour for a ſeaſon, waiting for the appeaſing of the Seas and ceaſſing of the Tempeſt: for ſo muche as the ſame beeyng aſſwaged, wee way diſpatche further in a day, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may duryng this rage in a moneth: for in doing of ſuch thinges, as you know, we muſt tary the oportunitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeaſon. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, ſith your pleaſure is, that wee ſhall ſaile on, I will not diſobay your will, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb facs="tcp:10374:106"/>we ſhall neuer (if I be not deceiued) accompliſh the ſame without ſome lamentable accident: aduertiſing you, that if God extende not his mercy to your ſuccour, the ende of our dayes is at hande. Howbeit, for all theſe wordes and many a teare beſides, whiche fell from the good Seamans eyes, who trembled for feare, ſeeyng the Waues like mightie Mountaines, offeryng to ouerwhelme them, and the Seas readie to ſwallow vp their veſſell, yet would not the Youth rele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor was any whit abaſhed, ſaiyng that either aliue or dead, he would paſſe further. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while the maiſter of the ſhippe tourned the Sailes towardes the Region of Fraunce: wherevppon the chief winde with ſuche violence ruſhed againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maine Maſte, that it had like to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen the Veſſell: but partly by the timely ceaſing of the boyſterous blaſte, partly by the incredible ſtrength of the Youth of the Fairies: who embraſing it in his Armes, held it with all his might, from leaning towardes the Seas, the ſhippe and all was recouered. Notwithſtandyng the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſurceaſed not, but continued ſo cruell and forcible, that it mought haue been compared to that, wherin the Troian Chieftaine <hi>Aeneas,</hi> was tourmoyled when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrathful <hi>Iuno</hi> (ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed againſt the remaines of <hi>Troy</hi>) had requeſted <hi>Aeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> to giue to his moſt fierce windes the raynes to torment hym. For their veſſell was with ſuch outrage toſſed to and fro, vppe and doune, and almoſt vpſidedoune, winde ſhaken and weather beaten, that when I conſider of it, I am forced to ſtande in admiration, wonderyng howe it could eſcape ſo horrible a ieoperdy without ſhipwracke: for ſometymes the Waues like Mountaines lifted theim vp aloſte, makyng them thinke that they were in aſcending into the Cloudes: againe the ſhippe fallyng doune betwene the mightie Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as it were in a déepe valley, made them to dread, leſt that Hell were openyng to deuour them vp. So that the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Paſſengers abandonyng the Tacklinges, began to crie mercie, knowyng no other remedie or reſcue from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10374:106"/>ſuch immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t daungers ſauing praier vnto God, with ſuch an hearte, as they poſſeſſe, who are ſurpriſed with the like hazard. Neuertheleſſe the mercileſſe rage of the windes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, Haile and ſharpe ſhowers fell aboundauntly, the Skies were quite ouercaſt, the Ayre wonderfullie darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the darkenes berefte the Sailers of all light, excepte it were that whiche proceedyng from the twinklyng eyes of the Whales, and Wherlepooles, or els of flaſhes of ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, intermedled among the ſtormy Raine, and forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nung moſt ghaſtly and hideous Thunder crackes, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Wheriewindes. But yet all theſe dreadfull acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes had no power to abate the noble courage or daunte the ſtoute Stomarke of the worthy and valiaunt Youth of the Fairies, ſtedfaſtly ſettled in a firme opinion, that all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was ſweete, all euill good, and all daunger, diſeaſe, and trauaile, to be repoſe &amp; aſſured tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillitie in reſpect of the vnceſſant, vnaſſwaged and remediles paine, which his reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les minde ſuffered by vehemencie of his amorous wounde: for albeit hee did ſee the greate parte of the Mariners, and the reſidue in the ſhippe, ſhifte out of the ſame, and commit themſeues vnto the Shipboate for their ſafegarde, yet hee not once offered to remoue hymſelfe from thence where he was: neither reſpectyng couerte from the brunt of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, nor reiectyng the vnſeaſonable weather, but accepting either in like parte. Which Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt towardes the euening, when the Veſſell had all daie runne at randon, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, began to ceaſe, and moderate his rage, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate windes packyng awaie, and giuyng place to the comfortable Beames of <hi>Dan Phoebus,</hi> who as then guided his horſe, wearie of their daies taſke towardes <hi>Thetis</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Now the Youth, who alone ſtaied in the Veſſell, with his truſtie Eſquire, that would not forſake hym in weale or woe, perceiuyng the weather to waxe cleare, gate hym out of a Cabin of the Shippe, where he had remained du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the Tempeſt, and mounting vppon the Hatches, hee
<pb facs="tcp:10374:107"/>might eſpie not farre from his Veſſell, the halfe of a ſhip flotyng, whiche the tempeſt had torne aſunder: within the whiche there was a man almoſt faintyng, and preſt to yelde his bodie to the mercie of the Waters, whoſe Waues had almoſt ouerwhelmed hym: yet betwixt ſinkyng and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng, he laboured to lengthen his life, without likelihood of recouerie, if an vnhoped hap had not reſerued hym from ſuche diſtreſſe, liyng in the maine Seas, depriued of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall forces, and diſtaunte from Lande any waie twentie Leages: but as hee was in this plight, a gratious gale of wind, did driue the Boord whereon he groueled halfe dead, towardes the Youthes Veſſell: who takyng pitifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, with diligent endeuour laboured to ſaue hym: ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not to deſpoyle himſelfe, ſtarke naked to leape into the water, and tying a Coarde of the Shippe about his bodie, ſwamme to the other man, and attainyng vnto hym, threwe hym the ende of the ſame Corde, whiche he ſtifly graſped in his nummed handes: this being done, he ſwamme again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his ſhip: drawyng the other after hym with muche adoe: into the which he mounted, &amp; being tyred, lifted vp the other beeyng hardly handeled and moyled in the ſalte wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: who beyng entered, fell doune in a ſounde, vomityng vp the water in great aboundaunce, whiche he had glutted in, at his Noſe and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Wherupon the Youth of the Fairies ſéeyng hym ſo faire and ſo comely a Perſonage, and geſſing by his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance that he ſhould be of ſome good houſe, employed al diligence poſſible, for the ſafe garde of his life, &amp; taking him &amp; lifting his feete vpwards, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe of his Eſquier, made them faſt to one of the Cables, and hanging his head downewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he powred out the water into the Sea, whiche remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Stomacke: after beeyng recouered from his ſwone, hee praied the Youth, that hee would vntie hym, for he felt no more paine, whiche he delaied not to doe, with all expedition, beyng ſo glad, as if he had founde the Treaſure
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10374:107"/>of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> or conquered the Romaine Empire, as well for that he longed to vnderſtand what he was, as alſo what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had brought hym into that diſtreſſe. Whereof hauyng demaunded, the other that was ſo enféebled and weried, by turmoyling in the water, that hee could not eaſely fetche breathe, requeſted hym inſtauntly, that he would vouchſafe hym ſome reſtyng place out of hand, and that after he were repoſed a while, he would recount vnto him his whole caſe. Then the Youthe knowyng that hee needed the ſame, and that hee vttered his woordes with muche difficultie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his Eſquier, that he ſhould leade him to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and laye him in his owne Bed, whervnto he obeyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently: but he was ſcarſe entered, when as the knight ſeeyng the Armes of the Youthe, and likewiſe the Speare that laye by his bed ſide, ſtaied for a certain ſeaſon, without ſpeaking one worde, (he was ſurpriſed with ſuche aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment): afterward touruyng hym towardes the Eſquier, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded hym heedefully, and remembred that hee had ſeene him not long afore: &amp; forthwith called to mind who he was: howheit without makyng ſemblaunte of any ſuche thyng, be began tovnaraie hymſelfe: and his apparaile (whiles he prepared hymſelfe to Bed) the Eſquier bare into the open ayre to drie: who failed not to rehearſe vnto his Maiſter, touchyng the countenance and behauour of the man, when as be behelde his Armour. Who beyng therefore more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous then he was afore, to knowe what he was, hyed hym into the Chamber, to common with the Straunger, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that the ſhippe without anie Sterneman did runne at randon: but at the firſt entrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> finding hym faſt a ſléepe, he would not awake him as then, vntill midnight came: when he had reſted hymſelfe a long ſeaſon, the Youth (who in the euening was layde doune by hm, noti diſpoſed to cloaſe his eyes all that parte of the night, by reaſon of the vnquietnes of his thoughtes) heard hym ſpeake in his ſleepe thus. <q>Ah Madame (ſaied he) and what will you ſaye when ye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
<pb facs="tcp:10374:108"/>of the death of your Knight?</q> After wallowyng from one ſide to another, and wauyng his Feete and Handes as though he would haue ſwimmed, he muttred in his dreame ſundry like ſpeeches, and complaintes, whereby the Youth who gaue good eare, perceiued that he was dedicate to the Heſtes of the Patroneſſe of <hi>Paphos:</hi> therfore both for that bee ſuppoſed the man to be troubled in mynde, through the fearefull obiectes whiche were preſented to his inwarde ſences as hee dreamed, and bicauſe his longyng to knowe what perſon hee was, did ſtill augmente, iogging the man harde with his Elbowe till bee was awaked, ſaied: <q>Ho, ho, Companion! what ayles you? you are further from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you were yeſterday, God bee thanked.</q> The man in his awakyng geuyng a leape (as it were one halfe agaſt) was recomforted when he founde hymſelf in ſo ſafe a place: for in his ſleepe hee imagined, that hee was yet in the Sea. Wherefore reuokyng to memorie the daungerous hazard from which by the Youthes aide then lying by hym, he was recouered, hee ſhewed not hymſelfe diſpleaſed for his late thruſtyng of hym, but ſhrouding hymſelfe againe vnder the couerte of the Bedclothes, began to ſpeake to hym on this ſorte: <q>Syr Knight (ſaied hee) if it ſeemed not offenſiue to you, I would inſtauntly requeſt you, to vouchſafe mee one benefite: aſſuryng you that I will in any matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng you, auoyde the crime of ingratitude, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thereof, as alſo in that you haue bene the onely refuge and reſcue of my liefe, out of thoſe apparant perilles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (hopeleſſe) I was enuironed: whiche cauſeth mee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte my ſelfe ſo muche bounde and beholdyng to your gentlenes, for your vnſpeakeable and exceedyng merites, that vnfainedly I doe acknowledge my owne power, farre, vnable to recompence the ſlendereſt parte of thoſe youre ſo high deſertes, yea though I doe aduenture my life in the hazarde of innumerable daungers, for the defence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of youres: vowyng furthermore, that you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

Wherfore as you eſtéeme my wordes true, &amp; my promiſe to proceede from a faithfull &amp; conſtaunt heart, I praye you to graunt vnto my firſt requeſt, which I neuer ſeemed to deny to any creature liuyng.</q> 
                  <q>Verily Syr (ſaid the Youth) of the Fairies, you ſéeme vnto mee ſo courteous and well ſpoken, that albeit you were but a meane Knight, and not deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from any royall houſe, as you haue vttered here, yet would I not once offer to conceale any thing whereof ye ſhould demaunde mee: alwaies foreſeene, that it reſteth in my power to doe: repoſing ſuche confidence in youre good nature and courteſie, that you will not forbeare ne diſdaine to ſhewe the like at myne inſtaunce, after that I haue ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffied your deſire, whiche I requeſt you not to differre: ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng you my woorde in faith of a knight, that you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no thing of mee, which (mine honour reſerued) I wil not attempte with my whole might.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I beſeech you then (quoth the other) that it would pleaſe you to diſcouer vnto mee who you are, and what Fortune hath forced you, beyng of ſo young yeres, to wander thus alone amids the Seas, and likewiſe, where you conquered the Harneſſe and faire Speare, whiche yeſterdaie at my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into this Chamber I did beholde: wherewith as I be leue, you arme your ſelfe, when occaſion offereth or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſtraineth ſo to doe: and the reaſon which moueth me to be deſirous to vnderſtand the firſt of theſe three thinges, is to the ende, that I may know the perſon certainely, vnto whom I ſtande ſo deepely endebted, that if I may poſſibly haue a thouſande liues to ieoperde in his defence, when neede ſhall require, they may in noe wiſe be ſpared: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am againe to deſire you to diſcloſe the ſame to mee.
<pb facs="tcp:10374:109"/>I promiſe you (ſaied the Youth) that ſince it is ſo, that you haue preuented mee, by demaundyng that whiche els I had enquired of you, I will not gaineſaie your demaunde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng a ſure truſte, that you will vſe the like courteſie to mee.

               <p>But ſettyng themſelues vppon the Puppe of their ſhip, as obiectes to the glitteryng beames of Dan <hi>Phoebus,</hi> as hée was addreſſyng his tongue, to finiſhe his rehearſall, by fortune they kenned a Veſſell that ſkmimed the Seas with wonderfull ſwiftnes, wherin as the ſame approached neere, thei mought eſpie two knightes armed at al pointes, who flouriſhing with their naked ſwerdes in their handes, and their ſhieldes vppon their Armes, manaced them more and more.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the varietie of matters heretofore handled, haue yelded occaſion to you my Lordes and Dames, of no ſlender ſolace &amp; recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo I doubt not but that the reſidue of this woorke which hereafter ſhall be ſet to open vewe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this Hiſtorie, wil ſuſpend your inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with the expectation of rarer delightes, &amp; delightfuller diſcourſes: and by performance of that which is pretended, ſatiſfie youre conceites, with ſurpluſage of pleaſaunte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. And now to proſecute our purpoſe, vnderſtande ye, that aſſone as the Youth of the Fairies had left his ſhip, which wandred upon the Sea, without any gouernement, and was entred into that whiche bee had conguered of the Pirates, who had attempted to aſſaile him, to their damage and vtter confuſion, with the aide of the man, whoſe life he had deliuered from the daunger of death, obiectyng hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to perilous hazardes for the others ſafegarde: for the ſelfe ſame perſon was he, whom he ſought for, to the ende that hee might reuenge the ſuppoſed death of his faithfull frende <hi>Phariſor,</hi> whom he thought to haue beene ſlaine by hym: beyng I ſaie ſailyng vpon the Sea in his verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and makyng great ſpeede to ouertake hym, who was no other where but in that Sippe, both to knowe if the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom he had taken, could tell any tidinges of hym, and alſo to vnderſtande who were thoſe Sea Robbers, whom he had ſlaine, hee did the meane while commaunde that the

               <p>
                  <q>My Lorde (ſaide he) as touchyng the Knight of whom you ſpake, I am to certifie you, that we haue neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode any newes: true it is, that yeſterdaie in the euenyng, when the Tempeſt that troubled the Seas, was aſwaged, as we were rouyng from one Coaſte to another, ſearching ſome praie to enriche vs, as we were accuſtomed to doe, by commaundement of the ſtrong Giant <hi>Squamel,</hi> our Maiſter who is brother to the moſte mightie and puiſaunt Knight <hi>Nabot,</hi> of whom there is no doubt, but you haue heard nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble report (foraſmuche as he is the moſt redoubted Knight formartial proweſſe, liuing at this day vnder the Sunne) we by chaunce encountred vpon the border of the faire Ile, whiche lyes not farre hence, belongyng to the ſaied mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous Giaunt, a Shippe, whiche the ſurges of the Sea had caſt to wardes ſhore, beeyng rent and wracked in many places. Within the whiche we hearde a greate tramplyng and noyſe made by a horſe, the gallauntſte and goodlyeſt I beleue in the whole world: who with his heeles bounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the boordes of the ſhip: whom we drewe for the, and ſent hym by one of our people that did leade hym by the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (for ride hym he durſt not) to our Lorde <hi>Squamel,</hi> with an Harneſſe, and Sword ſo braue, as poſſibly might bee, whiche we founde there alſo: and in the Shippe (wherof I will tell you) were the cogniſaunces whiche you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: and I thinke that the Harneſſe appertained to the Knight for whom you ſeeke: whom (notwithſtandyng) we ſawe not, nor knowe where he is become, except he bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong an infinite number of drowned bodies that be on the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10374:111"/>ſhore. In as muche as you demaund what we are, it ſéemeth vnto mee, that by the declaration I haue made you (beyng a ſage and wiſe Knight, as doth appeare) you may gather that you require, without any longer proceſſe. But tell mee (ſaied the Youth) what were thoſe two braue felowes who firſte enterpriſed to boorde our ſhippe:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Rouer then aunſwered thus: my Lorde, (quoth he) the man whom you ſlewe, was our Capitaine, and named <hi>Falſant,</hi> not ſo muche for that he was the moſte doughtie of our Maiſters Subiectes, as for a conſideration whiche I will recounte vnto you, if it like you to geue mee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng.

Firſte then my Lorde, before I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate vnto you that whiche I haue promiſed, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite (ſo that it ſtand with your contentment) the pedigrewe of the Giaunt <hi>Squamell</hi> my Maiſter, becauſe it importeth muche in that matter.

<pb facs="tcp:10374:112"/>by her, as many a tyme I haue hearde reported by theym that were liuyng) whereof a fewe remaine as yet, did ſo muche by her déedes and worthines, that ſhe as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereſſe entred the <hi>Indies.</hi> Where vnderſtanding by bruite of people, the famous renoume of a kyng of <hi>Gedroſia</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the lyne of Kyng <hi>Porus,</hi> that was vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Greate, and in knightly proweſſe far ſurmountyng the chiefeſt knight of thoſe daies, paſſed thervpon into the ſaied Realme of <hi>Gedroſia</hi> which is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Riuer <hi>Indus,</hi> from whence the greater parte of the Regions of the Caſte, doe take their name. Where (to be briefe) after a long and ſharpe conflict, ſhe ouercame the ſame kyng, who was called <hi>Corlorant,</hi> and ſubdued and brought vnder her obedience, not onely the Realme of <hi>Gedroſia,</hi> but alſo iourneyng to <hi>Ganges</hi> the Riuer, and the deſertes of <hi>Camul</hi> triumphed of the victorie whiche ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Cathay,</hi> in the fardeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of all the Caſt, enthronizyng her ſelf in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeate royal of <hi>Orientall Scythia,</hi> which otherwiſe is tearmed <hi>Tartaria,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynyng to the countrey of <hi>Bactria</hi> neere vnto <hi>Parthia.</hi> But not contented therewith, whether it be for that as you knowe, the more that ſome perſons abounde in riches, the greedilier they couet worldly wealth, or for that ſhe deſired to extende the fleight of her renowne further, and yelde a Teſtimonie of her hautie and inuincible proweſſe, to the vnknowen partes of the worlde, ſhe trauailed ſo farre, that ſhee attained to the extreme Confines of <hi>Africa:</hi> where malicious fortune ſpityng at her fame, plaide here a tricke of her waueringnes and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie. Now therefore as ſone as this valiaunt <hi>Virago</hi> and vauquereſſe <hi>Horfelle,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the Region of <hi>Spithanne,</hi> ſhe wondred greatly to ſee the inhabitauntes thereof ſo little, that ſixe of the talleſt that there could be found, being ſet one vpon another, could ſcarſe reache vnto her waſte: howbeit that hindred not the blinde <hi>Pigmey Cupide,</hi> to aſſaulte her more vehemently, then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10374:112"/>any her enemies in <hi>Gedroſia. Tartaria, Parthia,</hi> or any other parte whiche ſhe had beene in: who for to ſurprize her, and to giue her to vnderſtande, that he was more mightie then ſhe, for all her pride and iolitie, although before tyme there was none that could daunt her courage, purſued her beyng furniſhed with his Shaftes, Bowe, and flamyng brandes into that countrie, where by his ſubtile ſleightes he woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her in one of the ſoundeſt partes of her entrayles, after an other ſorte, then ſhe was wounded in the combat, which ſhe had with the hardy <hi>Corlora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> For ſhe was enamoured on the king of that countrie, in ſuch ſort, that ſhe could neither reſt by night, nor employe her mynde by day on other affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: ſauing in the féeding of her affections with thoſe ceaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conceiptes: albeit that this petite Prince was not paſt thre cubites in height, &amp; had to name <hi>Nabro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> at which thing Syr, thoſe that haue not taſted the experience of loue, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, haue beene greatly aſtoniſhed: as at a thyng impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but if they weigh well, that this pretie Archer hauyng his eyes ouercaſte with a blacke Cipreſſe bande, and his eyeſight bedewde therewith, can not clearely diſcerne what he doeth, after that his ſcorchyng Shaftes, beeyng guided as deſtinie dryues them, are ſhotte thicke and three folde among the multitude of mortall Wightes, hee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the greate as well as the ſinall, and contrariwiſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcyng the ſiſter to be ſometimes rauiſhed with an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fancie towardes her brother, as <hi>Biblis:</hi> the daughter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Father, as <hi>Myrrha,</hi> or the father towardes the daughter: I am perſwaded, that chaunging their opinions, &amp; ceaſing their aſtoniſhment, they wil not marueile a whit, if <hi>Horfelle</hi> that was of vnmeaſurable greatnes, was ſo rapt with the loue of a Pigmean Kyng, in ſuche maner, that in ſteede of employng her force againſt ſome ſtoute knight or Giaunt, or deſtroying horrible and fell monſters, ſhe helde hym company at ſuche tymes, as he with his manlinges wente to ſkirmiſhe with the Cranes: that were ſo greuous
<pb facs="tcp:10374:113"/>vnto them by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daily battailes, which they fought with them, that he ſeemed to bee in no leſſe extremitie, then <hi>Phineus,</hi> by the aſſaultes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foule <hi>Harpyies</hi> was, ſo that he could take no one repaſt at quiet. Howbeit beyng acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as before is ſhewed with this noble Dame (as was not vneaſy for him to procure, bicauſe of her extréeme paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) ſhe found her hearte ſhortly after exempt from theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For one day in an encounter and ſkirmiſhe betweene the <hi>Pygmees</hi> and Cranes, this amorous <hi>Horfelle,</hi> entending to giue triall with what affection ſhe would aduenture her ſelfe in his ſeruice, and howe muche ſhee alone exceeded in might and mayne, both hym and all his people together, by her onely preſence affrighted ſo theſe Maiſter Byrdes, that neuer ſithence they attempted warre againſte hym, nor as yet durſte approache the place where the Kyng ſoiourned. Vpon whiche occaſion <hi>Nabron</hi> conſideryng how muche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdyng he was to the Dame (whom he honoured, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as well as he could) on a certaine day made vnto her an offer of all the Treaſures &amp; riches which he enioyed in this world: for which the ſhe Giant <hi>Horfelle</hi> thanked him humbly, refuſing it as ſhe that was muche more abounding in wealth then he, and his Treaſures were farre vnfit and diſagreeyng from the Medicine appliable to her Maladie, whiche ſhe felt day and night, to reue her of all delight and contentation. Wherefore ſeyng the Path (to paſſe vnto the purpoſe which ſhe pretended) readie beaten, ſhe diſcouered at a certaine tyme her grief: &amp; beyng alone in the Chamber of the Kyng <hi>Nabron,</hi> did ſo coll hym and kiſſe hym, and vſed ſuch other wanton daliaunces, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the little dandiprat recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng in good part the fortune offered, not willing to refuſe the amitie of the Dame, for feare that he ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted a diſcourteous or ſottiſh perſon, made no conſcience or pauſe at the matter, but luſtily mounted vppon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, to vewe her throughly, without further proceſſe: for ſhe was beautifull and of a good grace.</q> And either of them
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10374:113"/>found ſuche ſweete taſte in this newe ſporte, that hauyng renewed the Combate often times, the faire ſhe Giant <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felle,</hi> at the ende of fiue monethes after the faſhion of the <hi>Pigmees</hi> was deliuered of a faire Childe: about a foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes after that, ſhee brought foorth another, whom nine monethes ſhe had conceiued and borne according as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature requireth: the one of them was named <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> and this is he who is famous throughout all the world, beyng endued with ſuche exceedyng force and marueilous hardines, that his piere liueth not this daye on the Earthe. This man in regarde of his hardines is the chiefeſt knight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court of the king of <hi>Thracia,</hi> who long ago ſailyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the <hi>Indies,</hi> arriued by fortune in the Realme of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamye:</hi> and there findyng <hi>Nabot,</hi> beeyng then a Childe, but ſtrong and ſturdie as poſſible might be in tender age, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit of ſo great ſtature, as at this preſente hee is (for he is ſcarſely thrée Cubites in height,) taking hym awaie, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caried hym into his Countrey, where he hath cauſed him to be nouriſhed and iuſtructed with ſuche curioſitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and likewiſe to bee trained vp in feates of Armes ſo carefully, that in fine by reaſon of his expertnes in Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affaires, &amp; worthineſſe of the ſaied <hi>Nabot,</hi> he is ſo feared and redoubted, that in <hi>Europe</hi> is no king that dare attempt to doe him any annoyance. But now to retourne to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp; to the ende, that I ſtray not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the path that guides me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme of my diſcourſe: it foloweth, that the other childe of the ſhée Giant <hi>Horfelle,</hi> and of <hi>Nabron</hi> the dwarfe, was herein vnlike and contrary to his Brother <hi>Nabot:</hi> for he was ſo huge, that in Childbirthe his mother died, &amp; is at this time moſte huge &amp; monſtruous in ſize, and piereles for force and proweſſe: he is named <hi>Squamel:</hi> whoſe ſeruaunt I was, &amp; alſo euery of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were ſlaine by you, who alſo is Lord and Ruler of the faire Ile, the moſt fruitfull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt place that is ſituate in all this Sea, whiche he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the meanes whiche I will tell you. You are to
<pb facs="tcp:10374:114"/>note, that after his natiuitie, beyng as then but a little one in compariſon of the huygenes of his body, at this inſtaunt he incurred ſuche fortune as his Brother had done before hym: for he was alſo ſtolne awaie by certayne Marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, who traueilyng into <hi>Indie,</hi> were by fortune driuen to ſhore, in the confines of his Fathers Dominions, from whence they caried hym awaie, and ſithence ſoulde hym to the Ryng of higher <hi>Myſia,</hi> for a greate Maſſe of Money: who likewiſe gaue order that he ſhould bée nourtured and brought vp honourably: &amp; gaue hym for my Eſquire, beyng as yet very young to ſerue his daughter, who was the moſt accompliſhed Lady in all perfection of beautie, that coulde be found, and was named <hi>Lucinda.</hi> Of this Dame, the yong Giant was enamoured, beyng now come to the age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the feruent heat of loue beginneth to augment, and that ſo exceedingly, that his liuely and ruddie colour tourned to pale and wan lookes: his bodie became leane and feeble, through wante of ſuſtinaunce, he eſchued all companie, and chuſed to liue ſolitarie. But all in vaine ſuffered hee thoſe tormentes and perplexities in reſpect of the ſqueymiſhnes of his diſdainefull Dame, who to counteruaile his hoate loue, becauſe of the greate ſtature and extraordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his lymmes, was ſo ſcornefully deſpiſed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectly eſteemed by her, as if hee had beene the baſeſt of her houſeholde ſeruauntes. Wherevppon his reſtleſſe though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes did continually ſo vexe hym, that either vnwillyng or vnable to recant his Religion, I meane to ſwarue from the ſeruice of the Sainet to whom hee had vowed all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and adoration, one daie it came into his fantaſie, to require the Kyng his Lorde to graunte hym the order of Knighthoode. The King who knewe that he was extracted from Royall linage, as the Marchauntes that had ſoulde him did enfourme his Maieſty, gameſaied not that motion of his, conſideryng therewithall, that his ſeruice mought ſtande hym in greate ſteede, by meanes of his ſtrength and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10374:114"/>mightines incomparable. <q>But immediatlie after hee was dubbed with that degree, hee abode not long there, but ſet hym ſelfe in queſte of ſtraunge aduentures, whereof he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably atcheued ſo many, that at this daye he is reputed one of the oddeſt Knightes vppon the face of the whole earth: as alſo his worthines, meriteth no leſſe reputation: for encountring his brother <hi>Nabot,</hi> by chaunce vpon a day, he fought againſt hym hande to hand, with ſuche furie, that their Combate endured a whole daye vntill the euenyng. When as eache of them (amazed at the valiaunce of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hauyng neuer as yet found any wight, that long could withſtand them) entered into queſtionyng one of the other, concernyng the place of their birth, and what they were: ſo that hauyng recounted their fortunes, as they ſometymes had hearde tolde by ſuche as nouriſhed theym, they knewe themſelues to bee brethren: and dooyng awaye all debate, éntertained eache other, with an other kinde of greetyng then all the day before they had done. Afterwardes iourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng both together, they were ſeperated, I knowe not by what aduenture, but in ſuche ſorte, that the Graunt (the fame of whoſe proweſſe was ſpread ouer all the Circuite of the world) came vnto the kyng of higher <hi>Myſia,</hi> where he was ſomewhat welcomed by his Ladye, who was glad of ſuche a one for her Knight. And feedyng hymſelfe with the conceipt of good happe, for that the Princeſſe had caſte certain glaunces towardes him, he tooke vpon hym at laſt, the boldnes to diſcouer his loue vnto her: who cuttyng of his ſuite with a ſhort and ſharpe aunſwere, compelled hym as then to deſiſte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enterpriſe: neuertheleſſe his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and ſecret fire, bruſſing at length into open and ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t flames, intolerably, &amp; continually vexyng him, made him to hazarde his ſpeache once more, to aſſaie if he could mollifie her indurate breſt, with the compaſſion of his miſerie: but the Dame perſiſtyng obſtinatly in her accuſtomed maner, aunſwered hym with the like denial as ſhe had done afore: howbeit not ſauced with ſuch bitter tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: which brought
<pb facs="tcp:10374:115"/>the Giaunt into conceipte, that her vntractable rigour and ſelfwill beganne ſomewhat to mittigate. Wherefore eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng fit oportunitie for the renuyng of his ſuite, he findeth meanes to haue acceſſe vnto her, being alone in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: where enteryng into communication, hee diſcourſeth vnto her, a faire and Courtly Tale: whereof he had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hymſelf afore hande, concernyng his extreme paſſions: ſettyng it forth to the vttermoſt, in wordes, voyce, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and geſture, concludyng euery ſentence with ſuche ſighing, that the ſcornefull Dame ſeemed partly to relent, renderyng hym an aunſwere tolerable inough. For (quoth ſhe,) I can not perſuade my ſelf, that your affections are ſo feruent as you (though fainedly) haue here expreſſed, ſeyng that you haue not as yet aduentured your ſelfe in any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, deſeruing my fauour: but if for my loue you will not ſhrinke to enterprize one Combate at my appoyntment, I will not ſticke to accepte you for my Knight and frende: ſo that you worthely atchiue the ſame. The Giaunt exceeding ioyfull of ſo wiſhed an aunſwere, ſaied, that ſhee ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde him nothyng (were it neuer ſo difficulte and vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie) but that in hope of her good grace, he would bryng it to paſſe. Mary then (ſaied the Dame) you are to goe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe to the caſtle of <hi>Melande,</hi> where you muſt fight againſt all them that you ſhal finde therin: and if you retourne from thence victorious, then you ſhall bee he that may diſpoſe of mee accordyng to your owne will. For I haue vowed, that no perſon ſhall purchaſe the graunt of my good will, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the fruites of my loue, but onely he that ſhal acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhe that act. Theſe wordes did caſt the Giant into his dumpes, eſpecially for that he had charged his owne ſhoulders with ſo troubleſome and heauie a burden: for it behoued hym to Combate with more then a Million of Deuils, who were encloſed in an old ruinous caſtle, beyng inhabitable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, beyng there ſet by the Inchauntmentes of an old Sorcereſſe named <hi>Melande:</hi> and to chaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out it was vnpoſſible for any, ſauyng for hym that ſurpaſſed all other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10374:115"/>Knightes in force and proweſſe. So it was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, that the Giaunt purpoſing with hymſelfe, that a ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and praiſeworthy death, was to bee preferred before a languiſhyng and vnhappy life (ſuche as he endured,) fayled not to put in execution the commaundement of his Dame. And did ſo muche by his worthines and courage, that hee defeated the Charmes of the Enchauntereſſe, and draue from thence the Deuilles: who daiely raiſed vp an horrible Tempeſt and vproare in the Caſtle: after departyng from thence, a victorious conquerout, he haſted to his Dame: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring her to perfourme her promiſe. She vnderſtanding thereof, and forced to her extremities, ſettled her wittes to the inuention of ſome miſchiuous practize: wherby the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntes daie might bee abridged. Wherefore, albeit at the firſt her outwarde countenaunce deſcried the inwarde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her ſpitefull hearte, yet to the entente ſhee mought the more certainly entrappe hym vnwares, ſhe entertained hym courteouſly inough, and lookyng foorthe at one of the caſementes of her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber windowe, that ſtode ouer againſte a Parke, wherein the kyng her Father had cauſed a greate multitude of Lions, Beares, Boares, and ſundrie other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beaſtes to be put, willed the Giaunt to looke out at an other, that thei might talke together, whiche hee preſently did: Deemyng hymſelfe happye in receiuyng ſuche fauour of his Dame. But as hee was in beginnyng to declare the vnfainednes of his affections, the Dame who was wilye and guilefull, ſeemyng to giue attentiue eare to his ſpeach, did let fal (as though it were by miſregard) one of her Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celets, garniſhed ouer with fine Diamondes, Rubies, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraldes, and other Precious ſtones curiouſly wrought, which ſhe was accuſtomed to weare on her Armes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ſhe ſéemyng to be ſomewhat agrieued, did complaine for the loſſe of her Bracelet. <hi>Squamel</hi> ſeeyng her grief concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the want of ſo riche and precious a Jewell, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtyng no whit the malice of his Maiſtris, offered rather haſtely then willingly to deſcende into the place, if it liked
<pb facs="tcp:10374:116"/>her: thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe loued him ſo wel, that ſhe would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit hym to aſſubiect his perſon to ſuch euident hazardes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuche a number of wilde Beaſtes: but his expectation was deceiued. For the Dame moſt inſtauntly required him to doe it, and hee without gaineſaiyng or delaye, furniſhed with no defenſible thing, excepte his Sworde only, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded deliuerly into the Parke of rampyng Lions and other cruell beaſtes: who had no ſooner perceiued hym, but like vnto a companie of dogges (when they ſee a Wolfe inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the flocke to catche a Sheepe) ſo ranne they from all partes to aſſaile hym: but ſo incomparable was his mighty proweſſe, in that exigent, that after hee had killed a greate maynie of them, hee eſcaped aliue out of that deadly daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, houbeit not without ſundry Woundes and Bruiſes: whereof reporte beyng made to the kyng, he was no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at the hardines of the Giant, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aggreued at the loſſe of his beaſtes: for hee tooke greate delight in the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them. Wherfore in his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he threatened to put the Giaunt to death without reſpect of the ſeruice done by hym. Who beyng aduertized of his diſpleaſure, cauſed ſixe or ſeauen greate ſhippes to be rigged for his ſpeedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoydyng out of the Realme of <hi>Myſia:</hi> to the ende he might eſcape the reache of the kynges power beyng his Lorde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he would not for any thing in the world make reſiſtaunce. Then committyng hymſelfe to the Surges of the Sea, bearyng an Ocean of Paſſions in his mynde, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure he tooke Congee of his Dame: who in ſteede of Adieu, vomityng out the venyme which ſhe caried in her cankred ſtomacke, ſhe vpbraided him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a thouſande iniuries and péeuiſhe ſlaunders: whiche might haue appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntly aſſured the Giant of the ſpitefulnes of his diſloyall Lady. Yet he making ſmall accompt thereof, and ſuppoſing that ſhe had ſpoken the ſame in ieſt, perſuaded himſelfe, that (ſuch diſcourteſie and miſchieuouſnes, findyng no place in the heart of ſo fayre and louely a Dame) it could not be but that he was ardently beloued of her, ſauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe would not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10374:116"/>haue it appeare, for feare leſt any ſhould thereof certifie the king her father. Wanderyng on the Sea, and blinded with this falſe opinion, by aduenture he diſcouered the faire Ile, whiche with the ayde of many of vs that were his eſpeciall frendes (who had accompanied hym in all that Iourny) he conquered, and eſtabliſhed hymſelf in the ſeate Royall, after that hee had chaſed hym that was in poſſeſſion afore, from thence: although he was a puiſſaunte Prince, and defeated the more parte of them that withſtoode his attempte. And in conſideration of the beauty, holſome ſite and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſame Ile, he determined to make the ſame a place of continuall aboade for hym during life. Now, for becauſe it is a place where many veſſels doe vſe to lye at Ancre, hee determined to ſpoyle as many as he could poſſibly catche, whiche hee omitted not to doe accordingly: ſo that by the Riches and Furniture whiche he hath purchaſed through ſuch kynd of pilling, he is become one of the moſt puiſſaunt and redoubted Princes that is in Gréece, except the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as ſometymes I haue heard hym reporte vnto the knight ſlayne by you: who had beene not long ſithence in his ſeruice in the company of the Duke of <hi>Chalcide.</hi> That knight fallyng extremely in loue with the Daughter of the ſame Duke, had required ſundry tymes her loue in lieu, but the proude and diſdainefull Damozell deſpiſing hym, did ſet light by his ſuite: wherat the knight takyng exceedyng indignation, and thinkyng to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as he walked abroade on a certaine daye, he met with a ſtraunger, who in his time had been ſo connyng in the arte of Magique, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his ſkill he had formed a Goblet of Gold (wherin were ſet many fayre Precious ſtones of value ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable) endued with ſuch vertue, that who ſo dranke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whatſoeuer the Potion were, ſhould bee enamoured on that perſon, who had poured the drinke into the ſaied Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Which he refte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore Magician, who had bene an exile of Perſia: for that the greate <hi>Souldan</hi> of that region would haue had it, to the ende he might purchaſe the loue of
<pb facs="tcp:10374:117"/>the Emperours daughter of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Thus hauyng recouered this enchaunted Cup, he founde meanes that his cruell Dame dranke therein, who was and is yet ſo entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the loue of a young Page, whiche ſomtymes ſerued her, that ſhe ſhrinked not to proſtitute her body, to be abuſed by hym in <hi>Venus</hi> daliaunces and diſportes: but to the ende he might bereue her of the ſwete delightes, whiche ſhe had with her newe loue, the knight ſlue hym: and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was forced to forſake his countrie, leſt he ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and puniſhed. As he was wanderyng on the ſea, entendyng to haue gone into Perſia, to ſell the ſame cuppe to the greate <hi>Souldan,</hi> hee was preuented, in his Iourney by vs: who vnder the conduct of our Maiſter <hi>Squamel</hi> (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that there artued no other ſhip at our Ile, by the ſpoile whereof wee might encreaſe our wealth as wee were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed) wee beganne to roue along the Seas from Coaſte to Coaſt, to get ſome good booty. And ſo this knight being taken as before is ſaied, the Giaunt <hi>Squamel</hi> commaunded hym to be Cloſed vp into an euill fauoured and lotheſome Priſon, in the companie of many others whom he had held there in miſerable thraldome: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ſuche tymes as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any voyage on the Sea, to apprehende ſome veſſelles paſſyng by, he cauſed them to be bounde very ſtraitly to the maſte: So that the ſame knight beyng there placed among the reſt, and chauncyng to heare the Giant complaine of the crueltie and rigour of faire <hi>Lucinde</hi> his Dame, tolde hym that if he would graunte hym libertie, hee would ſo vſe the matter, that the Giant ſhould be ſo muche beloued of her, as now he is hated, by the vertue of the golden Goblet, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we baue made mention. The Giaunt conſented thereto willingly. Afterwardes the knight hauyng deliuered it, he trauailed into high <hi>Myſia,</hi> where he found meanes to make his Dame ſecretly a Preſente of the Inchaunted Goblet, wherein he cauſed her to drinke, ſaiyng that it retained the property that the Dame or gentlewoman which he ſhould graunt to drinke in the ſame, ſhould become ſo faire, that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10374:117"/>ſhe ſhould be ſeconde to none in perfection of beautie. But the triall verified his woordes to bée vntrue, for in ſteede of augmenting of her beauty, ſhe is contrariwiſe ſo withered, wanne, and diſfigured, that ſhee hath loſte the principalleſt parte of her beautifulnes: ſhe hath euer ſince, and is ſtill ſo worne away by force of her amourous paſſion. For our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath purpoſed to ſuffer her to languiſhe ſo long, as he remained bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnder the ſeruile yoke of her loue. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he receiued ſuche contentation, that for the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of the gift offered vnto him by that knight, he conſtituted hym Lieutenante generall and vicegenent in his abſence, of the kyngdome of the faire Ile: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittyng vnto hym all charge to pill and robbe whatſoeuer he may by any poſſibilitie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto: whiche he endeuouring to accompliſh, this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture is happened vnto hym (and to the other knight beyng his coſin, and taken with hym whom your compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſlaine) whiche you knowe better then my ſelfe.

               <p>After that the Pirate had ended his tale, in the order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, the Youthe who attentiuely gaue eare, called to his remembraunce, that this Knight was the perſone, wherof the Ladie enamoured (lackyng her Louer) ſpake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as you heard reported afore, when he was ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his faithfull fréende <hi>Phariſor.</hi> Wherefore he reioyced not alittle, for that he had reuenged her quarell, in recompence of the intertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which ſhe had made hym in her Caſtle.
